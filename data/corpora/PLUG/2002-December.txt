Eric,

Do you only use up2date when RH notifies you that there is an errata,
bug fix, or security fix?  I believe that is the only time that it is of
value to utilize up2date.  Am I correct in this assumption?

I've noticed that up2date addresses dependency issues well.

TIA,

Jim

Rod, et al.:

  On the OO mail list I learned that others have had this experience, too. I
suspect the cause is related to the developers slavish devotion to making it
as Microsoft-like as possible. Ergo, no longer loading probably emulates
some Microsoft "feature" (such as having them shut down your software
remotely). All my opinion, of course.

> Appreciated!

  I fixed it. Let me explain my initial situation, then the fix.

  Copies of the OO tarballs were downloaded to /usr1/open-office/. When I
installed the application, it created the complete directory tree
OpenOffice.org-1.0.1/ under this directory. But, because I had specified
--prefix=/usr/local/, there was a duplicate tree there, too. I don't think
it was supposed to work that way, but there we are.

  The command string attacted to an xfce panel icon used to launch OO was
/usr/local/bin/soffice. This worked fine for just shy of thee months; from
the RH 7.3 upgrade on September 5th (and following couple of weeks) until
last Monday or Tuesday, right after I sent a proposal to a client. Whew!
Then, like Congress, the application decided to go home for the rest of the
year.

  So, I took my few template files and copied them to ~/oo-backup. Using the
verable and reliable 'locate' command, I found every instance of soffice and
removed them. Both directory trees were cut for sale as Christmas trees
using 'rm -rf'. Then I downloaded a new copy of the tarball as I hadn't kept
the old one around.

  This time I more closely read the linux install instructions on the Web
site, and I followed the recommendation to do the installation in /tmp. I
still used the --prefix=/usr/local, and let 'er fly. Then I did the
workstation installation and removed the entire /tmp/OpenOffice.org-1.0.1/
source tree. The final change I made may or may not have been significant.
The Web site's instructions for those of us not using Gnome as our GUI front
end is to invoke OO as '~/OpenOffice.org-1.0.1/soffice'. I _had_ been
invoking it as '/usr/local/OpenOffice.org-1.0.1/programs/soffice'.

  Now it loads once again. When I diff the two soffice files, nothing shows
up. Why there are two copies, and why the developers recommend one over the
other I've no idea.

  Unfortunately, I was not able to produce invoices yesterday because my
restored template files are still not visible to Writer. I'm working on this
today; have to, so I will get them working again.

HTH,

Rich

It isn't necessary.  If no name is specified, ln creates a link with the same

I primarily use up2date for errata, but it is also useful for installing
new packages & fixing dependancies.

If I wanted to install zsh, for example, I could run "up2date -i zsh" and
it would install the zsh package plus any missing dependancies.

If I tried to install a third-party rpm and it complained about a missing
dependancy, let's say it wants liblwres.so.1, I could use up2date to 
resolve the dependancy: "up2date --solvedeps liblwres.so.1"

Also note that up2date is just one part of the Red Hat Network. RHN lets
you push updates to multiple servers, document your configurations/changes,
and other such "enterprise-friendly" activities. This is very useful if you
have a big farm of servers to manage.

I've got Flashplayer 6.0 plugin working now.  I installed the Debian
"flashplugin-nonfree" package, which downloaded and installed the
version 6 flash plugin.  It just worked, with no fuss and no bother.

There is also a standalone "flashplayer" with a GPL.  I have not tried
that.

It is certainly NOT meaningless.  I also have just the base packages +
updates in my sources.list also.  The Debian distribution is just larger
than the Red Hat distro.  There are a lot more software packages to
choose from, particularly in the area of development libraries and
programming languages.  Yes, many are things that "nobody will ever
need", though of the packages in that category, many are interesting
programs to read the sources to.

What is the source of those RPM packages?  Are they guaranteed to be
valid packages in any way?  How thourough is the testing of them?  How
well validated are the people who create an maintain them?  What ensures
that they do not contain trojan horses or that they install files in
correct locations?

Hmmm...  Ok, I do have a few non-official URI's in my sources.list. 
They are for the XFree86 test packages, from the Debian X maintainer's
unofficial test site, the Blackdown Java packages, the Openoffice.org
packages, and the LTSP ones.

That is the nature of the "unstable" archive.  Everything is explicitly
allowed to be in flux wrt inter package dependancies, library versions,
and etc.  This is where everything gets worked out, evolved forward, and
made ready before it is frozen and stabalized for release.

The released archive ought to be very stable, with everything working
together correctly.  An upgrade from one stable release to the next
should proceed almost totally automaticly.  Almost.  There will probably
always be situations where that upgrade just CANNOT be done totally
automaticly, with no human intervention.

I work for a local ISP that has about 6 redhat machines. We cron up2date
-u every night on each machine to keep their security holes at bay.
Granted that some may wish to have more control than this over their
updates, but it seems to work well for us.

Go to /var/lib/rpm and delete all the __db* files. Then try again. 
This is a known problem with rpm 4.1.

That's true. If you want a big apt-cache, Debian is the clear winner.

Eric,

Do you run up2date from the command line or can you run it from a gui? 
I know that when I've clicked on the applet in the lower right hand part
of the panel that it opens a gui, but I only get an opportunity to
update whatever RH has available for my system.  Am I making any sense
here?  :-) Is the man page the best place to go to read about this?

TIA,

Jim

All of Red Hat's manuals are online, they're generally quite good. See if this 
has what you need:

Assuming you're still rassling RH8, this is a Unicode bug in the KDE man page 
viewer. The default character set for RH8 is Unicode, UTF-8. The catch is not 
all apps are Unicode-aware yet. Either use yelp, or Konqueror- man:foo.

See the Release Notes on disc 1 for lots of useful information, they are also 
on redhat.com. This may help too:

Ok, so Eric sees this as some sort of penis size contest...  He
completely ignored the questions I asked in my second paragraph.  Anyone
have a TECHNICAL repsonse to my earlier questions?

And for those RH users out there...  :-)

rob at duron:~$ rpm -qa | wc -l
      1

And for Slackware users....

rob at duron:~$ ls -l /var/log/packages/* | wc -l
    209

(that number is super-inflated as most all of the slack packages
installed have been overwritten with things I compiled from source)

It seems like all RH vs Debian contests are some sort of p.s. contest

Debian is better. Are you happy now?

When I type $PATH at the command prompt, I'm not quite
satisfied with what I see. If I want it different (and
the changes permanent), where do I make the changes? I
use Caldera OpenLinux 3.1, though this is probably not
a distribution-specific issue.

This question comes up again and again...  Let's search the archive for
it.  Here's how to do that...

First, access:

 http://new.pdxlinux.org/search.html

(Note that the above URL may change in the future.  At some point it
will be linked to from the main http://www.pdxlinux.org/ website.)

Then, in the search box, we type:

PATH

After a very long wait (that computer is slow and overloaded)...
Well, that's just way to long to wait, darn it.

Alright, darn it.  I'm going to have to fix that.  It finally returns,
but there's no way to restrict the search to the list archives.  Finding
them by hand, I see:

Here are two path-related tips that might be related to your task.  First, if 
you are performing your backup from cron, it is a good idea to use a script 
which explicitly sets the path since cron does not read the user's 
environment.  Second, it is a good idea to only store relative paths in your 
tar archive.  That way you can restore to a temporary location without wiping 
out the system that is already there.  This gives you the option of restoring 
individual files rather than the entire content of the backup.

If you're interested in more information on my second tip and general 
information on using tar for backups, see the Chapter 12 of the Systems 
Adminstrator's Guide from the Linux Documentation Project at

http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/index.html

and, more specifically, Section 12.4

http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/x2540.html

Enjoy,

Mark

Tim,

  What's not to like?

  The PATH variable is defined in ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.profile if you use
csh). When you want to add specific directories to your path variable, you
can always do so by appending; e.g., PATH=$PATH:HOME/bin:/some/place/else.

  The bash man page has details and so does the ORA nutshell book on the
bash shell.

Alternative to Karl's suggestion, and one that works on just about any website;

Put this in a google search: PATH site:www.pdxlinux.org

You can search for any term, site specific this way. 

If we wanted to have a good search on our main page, we could add a google search to our front page, and just use that. Then it would give you a way to search just the site, or all of the 'net. 

Take a look at my web page for an example of what I mean.

csh does not use .profile, never has.  ksh an sh use .profile as does

This method of adding to the PATH works, but since it
didn't solve the problem, I'll start from the
beginning, hoping that someone can solve it. Just the
other day, I installed (?) the GNU Scientific Library,
C subroutines for a wide variety of scientific
applications. Sure enough, the header files were
installed where they should be. So then I copied and
pasted the "Hello World" driver program into a text
editor, to try it out:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h>

int main (void)

{
	double x = 5.0;
	double y = gsl_sf_besselJ0(x);
	printf("J0(%g) = %.18e\n", x, y);
	return 0;
}

The compiler complains that this "bessel" function is
not defined--that is, that there is a call to an
undefined function. The function is in
/usr/local/include/gsl, so it seems that
/usr/local/include should be in the path, which it is
not. I used the suggested remedy to add this to the
path, but the problem persists. Could it actually be
that the people who wrote the manual for this library
wrote a five or six line program with mistakes in it?
If so, I'm going to bring it to their attention. In
any case, the benefits of using the package are such
that I'd like to get this solved.

  This is a different problem, Tim.

  Add the path where your scientific libraries are placed to
/etc/ld.so.conf. Then, as root, run /sbin/ldconfig. That rebuilds the
internal library data base. T'ain't a $PATH problem.

What you are looking for is the include path, not $PATH.  You can
compile your program above by adding a -I/usr/local/include to your
gcc command line.  Makefiles sometimes use special environment
variables to refer to these extra include directories.

I wasn't sure you had problems compiling the test code or not when you 
said the compiler complained about something not being defined...For 
include files and the C compiler, use the -I argument that tells the 
compiler what directories to look in for finding header files. If you 
have multiple directories you can specify the -I argument multiple 
times on the command line. For telling the linker what directories to 
locate libraries in you use the -L argument

e.g.

gcc -I/usr/local/include -c world.c

Assuming you have a library named libgsl in /usr/local/lib you can link 
to it using the following command.

gcc -L/usr/local/lib -lgsl -o world world.o

Tony

P.S. I don't use GSL and so I don't know if my naming conventions are 
correct for linking the code or not but you get the general idea.

Subject: [PLUG] Mailman and Postfix
Message-ID: <20021202200001.GB6736@dalsemi.com>

The server I work on has a main name, "rock", and it's aliased to "www",
"ftp" and last week we just added "lists" to the bunch so that we can
run mailman.

The install went great, but when it sends out email, it comes from
"rock" instead of "lists".  I don't know how to tell if this is
a mailman or a postfix problem (or something else).  Does anyone
have suggestions on:

1) How to figure out which program is causing the problem
2) Maybe seen something like this and know how to fix it?

Thanks,
Colin

I believe that this is a postfix problem.  I believe that you need to create 
an appropriate entry in the sender_canonical file, run the command "postmap 
sender_canonical" to create the corresponding aliases database, and then load 
the changes using the command "postfix reload".  I could be wrong about the 
specific file you need to edit since it has been awhile since I read through 
the postfix docs.  So look for sender_canonical in the postfix documentation 
to see if what I've said makes sense.

Good luck,

Mark

If you want all mail from your host to come from "lists" then you can
edit the /etc/postfix/main.cf file where it says "myorigin = " to look
like:

myorigin = lists.$mydomain
and it should work

So if I want mail to come from either "www" or "lists", would the
config then look like this:

myorigin = www.$mydomain, lists.$mydomain

In the latest version of postfix, 1.1.12, it's in
/etc/postfix/canonical,

but I think setting $myorigin may do the right thing, since right
now I'm just getting the default.  If it doesn't I'll try this next.

Thank you!

Yes, I did. But my procmail put it in the wrong folder, and I just now
saw it. I also liked your response, Sandy. Very well done!

The PLUG list server's canonical name is "drizzle.pdxlinux.org".  It has
several other names, including "mail", "lists", "www", and "cvs".  The
mailer is Exim 3 (we have experimental Exim 4 packages now!), and the
mailing list manager is Mailman.

The matching exim 3 manual is at:

 http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/exim/manual.html/spec.html

... and I think that you will find that it's easy to find things in, so
you can compare what I describe here to the similar settings for
Postfix.  If anyone would like a copy of the Exim 3 configuration from
drizzle, just ask me in private email.

Exim is configured to accept mail for any of those host names -- that
is, "local_domains" is set to a list of hosts.  "qualify_domain" is set
to "drizzle.pdxlinux.org".  That is the domain that is added to all
unqualified addresses (you'll find it easily in the FM).  This is what
to change, in Exim, for all email that does not already have a "From"
with a FQDN in it, to make it say whatever you like.  (Hmmm... perhaps
on drizzle, "qualify_domain" ought to be "mail.pdxlinux.org".  Maybe
I'll change it.)

There are no header rewrite rules except for a "headers_rewrite" in the
"lists_transport" transport I have configured.  Those look like this:

  headers_rewrite = plug at pdxlinux.org plug at lists.pdxlinux.org

This is for the transition from the old address to the new one, adding
the "lists" host part to facilitate future growth or reorganization of
the pdxlinux.org domain.  (This is considered best practice.) 
Presently, drizzle will accept mail for pdxlinux.org, since there is an
MX for it, pointing to the A record for mail.pdxlinux.org, presently the
same IP as the A record for drizzle.pdxlinux.org, which is what
"hostname" reports, if you log in.)

The Mailman lists are all configured to use "lists.pdxlinux.org" as
their base domain name.  That is where all the mail coming from the
lists appears to originate from.  Thus, this setting is in Mailman, and
not in Exim.  I believe that you will most likely find the same to be
true for Mailman + Postfix.

Once again, anyone wishing a login account on drizzle, so you can
explore, email me your ssh 2 id_dsa.pub, user name, full name, and
daytime telephone number.  You may view any file on the machine that has
read permissions set.

Your search - PATH site:lists.pdxlinux.org - did not match any
documents.

Darn.  I need to fix that.  I think I'll get rid of the search engine on
www.pdxlinux.org, and just try to get google to index our list
archives.  Sound alright?  Any other suggestions?

Htdig is not really that great.  It reindexes everything every day,
since it has no incremental update.  It really ties up the machine while
it's running, also.

Depends on whether you actually consider it broken. I can't see if you are being sarcastic or not... :p

I'm assuming that google hasn't crawled the archives because it A) doesn't know about it, or B) there's a robots.txt file telling it not to crawl it.

I've heard good things about www.mnogosearch.com. I have no idea if what I've heard is true, because I haven't gotten to setting it up myself. Supposedly, it's lighter on the system than htdig, but it does use a mySQL database. So that, in turn may be hard on the system.

Well, sort of.  If it was me, I'd install a pre built "libgsl-dev"
package from Debian:

karlheg at bittersweet:~
% apt-cache search gsl
gsl-bin - The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- binary package
gsl-ref-html - The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) Reference Manual in html
gsl-ref-psdoc - The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) Reference Manual
libgsl0 - The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- library package
libgsl0-dev - The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- development package
karlheg at bittersweet:~
% su -
root at bittersweet:~
# apt-get install libgsl0-dev gsl-ref-html

... and save the trouble of maintaining a current version, etc.  It
would be installed and ready to use in less than five minutes.  This
puts the headers in "/usr/include/gsl/", findable via the standard -I
path with #include <gsl/*.h>, and puts the .so libraries in /usr/lib,
which is on the standard -L path.  You still need, of course, the
"-lgsl" on your link command line.

By the way, that documentation is installed on www.pdxlinux.org, in:

 http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/gsl-ref-html/gsl-ref_toc.html

(I've installed just about every -doc package available in the Debian
distribution!  Try the /doc/ URL once.)

If you needed to look at the source code to libgsl0 itself, you could
just type:

% apt-get source libgsl0

... and there it would be, ready for edits or rebuilding with custom
options.  (Just edit debian/rules ...)

Have you looked at Swish++? 

http://homepage.mac.com/pauljlucas/software/swish/

It has the ability to index mail, news, XML, HTML, just about anything. I've 
used it with great success for several large projects (indexing several 
hundred thousand documents) over the past few years.  Also, it is very fast.  
I'd be happy to help if needed.

Alright... It's available pre packaged from Debian also...  Does Swish++
perform incremental (If-Modified-Since) updates?  Can it parse PDF and
PS files?  Will it handle Content-Encoding: x-gzip ?

No, I was serious.  I checked, and made sure that the robots.txt (see
below) was what I thought it should be, and that the lists archives are
available via straight HTTP, rather than the HTTPS required for access
to the Mailman admin pages.

> I'm assuming that google hasn't crawled the archives because it A) doesn't know about it, or B) there's a robots.txt file telling it not to crawl it. 

I think it's probably A.  We need a link to them from the main site or
something.  Maybe we can hide it in a site map or something?  Geoff? 
I'll leave this up to you; you decide how to link them in...  There is a
robots.txt:

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/robots.txt

I think it's what we want.  I excluded several of the indexes, leaving
only the by thread index for web crawlers.  (So be sure and link to
them!)

Another thing I might try is to ditch pipermail in favor of... shoot. 
What's it called now...  Well, in favor of that nicer one I saw that
builds the output HTML/XHTML lazily, when accessed.  Hmmm. though a
crawler would force it to build them all.  Perhaps such a thing should
record access by robots, and check "If-Modified-Since", so only the
first time the robot traverses the list archive does it generate the
XHTML.  The generated XHTML are likely purged after a period of
non-access.  It keeps the mail as an mbox file, IIRC.

mngosearch uses a PostgreSQL database that can grow very large when you
index huge web sites.  The PLUG server has a LOT of documentation
installed on it.  In my experience, mngosearch will take more than one
day to index that much, especially on the Celeron 4xx MHz we have.  It
would also eat up a huge amount of disk space for the database.

Has anyone else tried mngosearch?

Swish++ can perform incremental updates.  It indexes PDF and PS files by using 
a "filter" specified in the config file. The filter is nothing more than a 
program used to handle that file and convert the contents to text. I think I 
am using pdftotext for PDF. It can handle gzip as well.  Looking at my setup, 
I think you could probably filter just about any extension.

	Guess that you "hard-core Linux" guys don't care about

you?

Subject: [PLUG] chunk_free consolidate forward clarification ( was RE: malloc and
 threads)
Message-ID: <288F9BF66CD9D5118DF400508B68C4460701D8C0@orsmsx113.jf.intel.com>

Looks like there is a bug in the chunk_free code in glibc 2.2.2 at
line:3131.When consolidating forward,I think the code is consolidating an
in-use block by looking at the
next+nextsz block's in_use_bit.

If the blocks are in the order [IN-USE] [IN-USE] [FREE]. If I'm freeing the
first IN-USE block ,consolidate forward is consolidating the second [IN-USE]
block by looking at

the [FREE] block's in-use bit.

Does anyone know if this bug is already reported and fixed? 

Here is the code from glibc:2.2.2 , malloc.c

===============================================
if (!(hd & PREV_INUSE))                    /* consolidate backward */
  {
    prevsz = p->prev_size;
    p = chunk_at_offset(p, -(long)prevsz);
    sz += prevsz;

    if (p->fd == last_remainder(ar_ptr))     /* keep as last_remainder */
      islr = 1;
    else
      unlink(p, bck, fwd);
  }

  if (!(inuse_bit_at_offset(next, nextsz)))   /* consolidate forward */
  {
    sz += nextsz;

    if (!islr && next->fd == last_remainder(ar_ptr))
                                              /* re-insert last_remainder */
    {
      islr = 1;
      link_last_remainder(ar_ptr, p);
    }
    else
      unlink(next, bck, fwd);

    next = chunk_at_offset(p, sz);
  }
  else
    set_head(next, nextsz);                  /* clear inuse bit */
============================================================================

Well, there are bugs in the ARM locking code.  I recommend interested
parties look at the conversation between myself and Richard Earnshaw
about this on the gcc-patches list, on Oct. 4th-7th:
  Subject: Atomic operations on the ARM

I don't believe it will affect malloc's use of locks; in short
test-and-set works but exchange-and-add is not atomic.

I'm not sure if compare_and_swap works correctly or not.  A glance
suggests that it does not.

Gee, it sure is nice to see people who have such a strong grasp of the
concepts and reasoning behind PGP in general.

GPG signatures... egotistical, silly, smug?

You put your name in each of your emails to the list.  How is that
really different?  Many people append a few more bytes to their posts to
*prove* they are who they say they are.  Is this small extra token
really so silly, smug, and egotisitical?

PGP/MIME is *the right way* to do PGP signatures, which are a good thing
in general.  If you insist on using a stupid mail program, why should it
hold the rest of us back?

I don't like it when off-list things are taken on-list, either....

You aparently have no understanding of PGP.  That is sad if you've
really been using it since 1996.

Simply appending a key to the email does *nothing* to prove you are who
you say you are.  A key is a static thing - it does not change depending
on what is in the email.  A signature, on the other hand, is created
with the private key and the message.  If you change one byte in the
email, the signature would change... and since only the private key can
generate the signature, somebody else cannot just willy-nilly change the
signature to match the edited message.  Hence, PGP signing verifies the
message you received was indeed written and signed by the person who
signed it....

I think maybe what your problem is with is actually PGP/MIME, not PGP
itself.  PGP/MIME is a way of signing emails or any other MIME
messages... it uses MIME and is the 'right way' to sign an entire email,
attachments and all.  Some stupid mail clients can't properly utilize
it, though... lookOut Express being one of them.  I know from
experience, though, that you can just view an attachment without
permanently saving it somewhere on your hard disk.

Plaintext PGP is harder to do, depending on the mail client.  The
developers of Evolution, for example, decided that PGP/MIME was the
*only way* to do it, so they do not recognize nor support plain PGP
singing.

Since PGP/MIME is the right way to do it, it would make more sense for
those clients that don't properly render it to fix themselves than for
those clients which only support it to start doing things the old
fasioned way.

To sum it up, Pat:  Get a clue.  PGP helps identify that you are who you
say you are, not show your smugness.  PGP/MIME is the right way to do
things, so it makes no sense for people to revert to doing things the
old way because a few folks with stupid mail cilents cannot easily view
the messages.

Patrick,

I generaly stay out of such issues but if you would be so kind I would
like some clarification in this matter.

In your email you state:

    ``Guess that you "hard-core Linux" guys don't care about Eschelon
    too much. Can't claim that your E-mail messages didn't come from
    you, when they contain an authenticating PGP/GPG signature, can
    you?''

This seems to be an attack. What's not clear to me is exactly whom you
are attacking, ``hard-core Linux guys,'' or people who include their
PGP/GPG signature in their emails. Knowing that these encryption
techniques also exist (and are widely used as they are a standard) for
Windows and other platforms, I am having trouble equating the entire
Linux community with PGP/GPG users.

Would you please help me reconcile this?

Further, you make mention of Eschelon...

    ``Guess that you "hard-core Linux" guys don't care about Eschelon
    too much.''

I sense that there is some background information that I am not privy to
so I cannot comment on Eschelon itself other than to say that if they
are adhering to the same standards as the rest of us (including PGP/GPG)
then there should not be a problem. Otherwise the signature will appear
as text at the bottom of the message.

When you say, 

    ``Can't claim that your E-mail messages didn't come from you,[sic]
    when they contain...PGP/GPG signature,''
    
well, I guess that's pretty much the point. Signatures are the author's
honest assertion that the messages are authentic. Far from being
``egotistical,'' it is in my view an indication that the author clearly
takes responsibility for his communication and is a gaurantee to the
recipient that the message is genuine.

I personally am reassured when I see the PGP/GPG information at the
bottom of an email message, whether it is an attachement or not; even if
I do not take the time to authenticate against it I use the signature as
a contributing factor for determining the authenticity of the message. I
check all keys, however, for critical messages.

Of course this may be a moot argument as I am still unsure if you are
talking about ``text PGP'ers'' or the Linux community on the whole.

Finally you make the following argument:

    ``In the spirit of all of us - with diverse OS's and experience
    levels - getting along, you guys COULD easily just append a KEY file
    to the E-mail, and not a full signature.''

I agree with you that we should all work to make things as easy to as
wide an audience as possible...but not at the expense of security.
 
The fact that an individual can attach the signature as a file isn't the
point. The truth is that they're playing by the rules. If on the
delivery side you've chosen a system based on ``what's popular'' rather
than functionality and standards adherence, then it seems you've only
given yourself rope with regard to others who do adhere to the standard.

Besides, if your client were open source you will likely find a module
that enables PGP decryption. Short of that you could write your own,
have someone do it for you, or at the very least submit it as a feature
request.

Cooper:
	Certainly ... since you asked ...

	I'm simply pointing out that "joe E-mail sender" can claim 
that a particular message (which might be construed by the Escheleon 
spy network as "subversive") was not sent by him, but was "spoofed" - 
that is unless he goes to the trouble of "signing" it with PGP/GPG, 
as some PLUG-ers seem so intent on doing.

	It's not an "attack", as I'm not threatening anyone.  (More 
elucidation follows ...)

	This would be a fine and noble thing, if it weren't for the 
fact that (as far as I can tell) ALL - or nearly all - of the major 
MUA's are "broken" with respect to the RFC's that specify how a 
program should handle PGP/GPG "signatures".
	The dashed line(s) that comes before and after such 
signatures set off the "signature" file and are rendered as a 
separate attachment when received by the Eudora, MS Outlook Express, 
and (I believe) MS Outlook mail agents. That would seem to account 
for well over 90% of the E-mail programs in use. I have received 
several postings from Eudora tech support which confirms THEIR 
program cannot be changed to "fix" this problem.
	Like many of you, I'd like to see ALL programs conform to the 
relevant RFC's. However, unfortunately, many do not - Microsoft's 
programs, in particular.

	My position is that it's "egotistical" to assume that such 
broken programs can be avoided by most computer users, and that those 
people who insist that everyone use a RFC-compliant MUA aren't being 
realistic, much less helpful. Moreover, I feel that it's 
"egotistical" to believe that your particular E-mail is SO special, 
that you (someone) has to make SURE that everyone knows that YOU sent 
it.

-->	Perhaps - as I requested in my earlier post - some savant can 
provide a (complete?) list of the E-mail programs that DO NOT 
separate PGP/GPG "signatures" as attached text files? Naturally, such 
a list should include programs available for non-Linux OS'es.

	If the message is THAT critical, then you and the sender 
should encrypt the ENTIRE message, and use Public/Private key 
combinations between you.

	Not all of us  - "us" being defined as everyone on the PLUG 
mailing list - can afford to be exclusively Linux. Many of the PLUG 
members that I know, use "mixed" environments to do their work. IMO, 
the PLUG list should be accommodating in this regard.
	Those of us who use "popular" E-mail programs should NOT have 
to delete/trash as many as a dozen "Untitled" or "Unknown" text files 
every day - just because a very few people on this list think that 
PGP/GPG is "cool" and somehow necessary to their computing 
experience. The list does not support HTML E-mail postings, due to 
that same reasoning.

	Just my $0.02.

That *IS* the point. If all valid communications from someone *ARE* signed, then a spoofed one, that is *NOT* signed can all the more easily be dismissed or otherwise discounted as invalid and not from the apparent author. 

You can't prove where a message actually came from, unless it's signed, and that private key has not been compromised. That's a point that many people just don't get.

So, it's your assertion that because many mail programs are broken, everyone should cow to the broken programs and not use the abilities in their non-broken programs. 

That's sort of like arguing with the judge that everyone drives 75, so you shouldn't have been given a ticket for it. 

It's more a responsibility of the authors of the broken programs to fix them. They will only do this if enough of their customers demand it. For Qualcomm to say it's not possible is completely bogus. It may not be easy for them, and they may not have enough incentive to do so, yet, but it's far from impossible. The properly working programs prove that it can be done. 

I'm not even going to go into Microsoft, they're broken by default, and don't seem to care.

It's also egotistical to complain to folks about non-standards compliant programs, because the standards compliant programs "break" them. It's not the standards compliant programs fault that what you choose to use is broken.

Why do you bother to trash them? They aren't very big, and the effort to trash them probably outweighs the space they take up.

So, how do I figure out what to use for the FQDN for the machines in my
home network? I am using my Netgear router's dhcp server for an ip
address. The router is connected to the attbi cable modem. I have given
most of my machines names based on their manufacturer since those end up
being unique. In my case, I would have put HOSTNAME=avatar in the above
line. What should it be if it is supposed to be a fully qualified domain
name?

On that (RH 8.0) machine, when logging in from the x login screen, I get
the following message after entering my user name and password:

--------------------------------------------------------------

	Could not look up internet address for dhcppc3.
	This will prevent GNOME	from operating correctly.
	It may be possible to correct the problem by adding
	dhcppc3 to the file /etc/hosts.

		[Log in Anyway] [Try Again]

--------------------------------------------------------------

I select [Log in Anyway], I get logged in, and I can surf the net. I
would expect that information to be provided by the router, and not be
something I put into /etc/hosts, unless the router's supposed to be in
there in some way.

My /etc/networking file reads:

NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=avatar

My /etc/hosts file reads:

127.0.0.1	localhost.localdomain	localhost
192.168.0.254	nec	nec

(The second entry is another machine in my network. It is running apache
and I can connect to it from Mozilla by typing "nec:" in the location
box.)

My /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file reads:

DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
DHCP_HOSTNAME=avatar
USERCTL=no
PEERDNS=no
TYPE=Ethernet

Typing the command, hostname returns dhcppc3.

Richard,

My /etc/sysconfig/network file is:

  NETWORKING=yes
  HOSTNAME=arthur

I didn't use a FQDN, but if you want, just make up one, like
dell.richard.com or whatever. It can be anything since it's on your
private LAN.

If your IP is set statically, you can add a line to your hosts file,
like:

  192.168.0.10   dell.richard.com   dell

I'm not sure if this is the correct way to do it, but that's how it is
on my four Linux boxes at home, and it works.

If you're going to argue against the use of something so vehemently, you
should have a 'ing clue what you're talking about.

The dashed lines are *not* the cause of the stupid MUA's showing an
attachment.  It has to do with PGP/MIME, a way of signing emails so the
entire message - including any possible attached files - is signed.

I would be very very disgusted in any MUA that interpreted dashed lines
like that as an attachment - that's more broken than most get (although
a similar trick can be used to fool OE into thinking a usenet post is
MIME-encoded).

The mail clients are broken - why are you using them?  Hell, AOL even
renders them properly.

"Because everybody else is doing it" just doesn't quite hold up.

And again, you misunderstand the reasons for PGP signing of emails.  I
also can see you aren't interested in the reasons...

Well, I'll start the list - I know AOL is able to properly understand
PGP/MIME.  I think Netscape/Mozilla does as well, but I'm not sure.

Pine understands them, Mutt does, Evolution does, KMail does, Sylpheed
does... I haven't run in to a Linux client that didn't understand
PGP/MIME.

Again, more misunderstanding.  You clearly have no understanding of PGP.

Encrypting a message over a public mailing list is very rude.  If you
mearly want to be sure of the identity of the sender, not necessarily
keep the contents secure from prying eyes, encryption is overkill and
stupid.

Encryption and signing, while based on similar technology, have two very
different uses.  Signing verifies the integrity of the data and the
identity of the sender.  Encryption keeps all but those who are supposed
to have access the data away from it.

This whole 'attach the key to the email' thing is stupid - Patrick
*must* have mismatched terms, I hope.

And, PGP/MIME does just that - it attaches the signature to the email as
opposed to putting it inline.

Are you required to use Outlook or Outlook Express for email?  If so,
whatever for?

If you're in a mixed environment, why don't you do your email in Linux,
where all the clients aren't broken?

Or, if you're stuck in Windoze and can't figure out a way to deal with
this (an added two clicks to view an email message)... perhaps AOL would
be more to your liking.  I can help you get that set up if you like...

*View* the attachment instead of downloading it.  That puts it in a temp
folder and opens it immediately.  No mess.  If you insist on using
braindead MUA's, at least use them as inteligently as possible.

Since this *is* a Linux users group - and nearly all Linux mail clients
aren't broken in this regard - banning PGP/MIME signatures would be a
very strange thing to do.  Those who insist on using stupid mail clients
can click those extra two clicks to view the attachment.

You can use openssh for both text and graphical remote logins.  In fact, I 
strongly discourage you from using telnet to connect to any system connected 
to the Internet and recommend ssh instead.  If you have a network that is not 
attached to the Internet, using telnet is okay but is still a bad habit.  By 
"graphical login", I'm assuming that you mean being able to run X 
applications remotely.

See http://www.openssh.org for details or, if you have a Linux box with 
openssh (or non-open ssh for that matter) installed nearby, type

man -k ssh

to see a list of relevant man pages, which can subsequently be viewed by 
typing

man command_name

Dick,

You're looking for the secure shell, or ``SSH.'' Secure shell offers you
a way to log in securely using a key-based authentication system and
encrypted communications over the network.

In the practical sense, once it's set up, it's really easy to use and it
also automatically exports the display of an application you run from a
remote machine to the machine you are on.

See the following link for details:

All I changed was the /etc/sysconfig/network file to HOSTNAME=dell and
then in the /etc/hosts file I changed the second occurance of localhost
to dell and it worked.  I'm in the same situation as you, sitting behind
a router serving an IP (which each computer obtains via dhcp from the
router) and that router connects to my ATTBI.com modem.  No problems, no
warnings when logging into gnome.  I did get that error when I did not
change both files.

I guess I should add my two shekels since it was my off-list reply to
Patrick which found its way (in part) back to the list after I shared it
with others as concerned with security and identity as am I. If you use a
"mixed" environment, then that surely includes a web browser and a news
reader - both of which can be used to access the list, perhaps with less
annoying behavior than your chosen MUA.

I won't bother repeating the distinction between popular and broken, but I
will say the math is flawed. Of 2841 posts since 01 August 2002, 78 were GPG
signed. 78 in 4 months. The most for any single day was 5 (two occurrences).

I'll be happy to post to the list the entire email I sent you off-list if
you'd like me to share it, Patrick. I think my tone was quite reasonable,
and I did offer you helpful suggestions - advice you have chosen to ignore.

A sound principle (albeit not the config for PLUG) - but unrelated to what
went awry in this particular case. Patrick sent me directly (i.e. off-list)
an email requesting that I not sign my posts to PLUG. I replied to him
directly. I then forwarded my reply to two other PLUGgers who PGP sign their
posts to ask if I was singled out. One of them mistakenly (I assume)
redirected their reply to the list rather than to me directly. Since the
origin of the chain was off-list, the above principle was not part of the
equation.

Okay, I spoke too soon.  I tried setting up my printer and came up with
an error message when starting lpd.  The error I got was robbert
Get_local_host: 'localhost' IP address not available.  I had to reset my
hosts and network files back to localhost to get lpd to start properly. 
Not sure why.  Any suggestions on how to work around this?

I've had good luck by adding an alias to /etc/hosts
like so,

127.0.0.1	rufus.localdomain	localhost	rufus

you don't want to do away with localhost

After this log out and stop X and do,
# service network restart



Cheers,

Does your /etc/hosts still have localhost in the 127.0.0.1 line?

AFAIK, you can (should?) list multiple names in a single line, i.e. you 
should list dell in addition to localhost, rather than replacing 
localhost.

I did not say that it would not work. I said that linux likes to have

You may someday run across a situation where it does not work as you 
have it configured.

Then again, you may not.

This (advice below) seemed like a good idea to me, so
I tried it. Only the test file was called "gslfirst.c"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h>

int
main (void)
{
  double x = 5.0;

  double y = gsl_sf_bessel_J0 (x);

  printf("J0(%g) = %.18e\n", x, y);

  return 0;
}

I should use such a command to perform the linking.
I've despaired of doing it any other way, since
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is nowhere to be found. Unfortunately,
it didn't go down, as a segment of the output below
shows. After that I have appended a listing of the
content of the /usr/local/lib directory.

[rtk at analytic rtk]$ gcc -I/usr/local/include -c
gslfirst.c

Ok here, apparently.

[rtk at analytic rtk]$ gcc -L/usr/local/lib -lgsl -o
gslfirst gslfirst.o

/usr/local/lib/libgsl.so: undefined reference to
`cblas_dsdot'
/usr/local/lib/libgsl.so: undefined reference to
`cblas_dswap'
/usr/local/lib/libgsl.so: undefined reference to
`cblas_zaxpy'
And on, and on, and on...

Contents of directory /usr/local/lib:
electric       libgslcblas.la    libgslcblas.so.0.0.0 
libgsl.so.0
libgsl.a       libgslcblas.so    libgsl.la            
libgsl.so.0.3.0
libgslcblas.a  libgslcblas.so.0  libgsl.so  

I don't give up easily. Any further comments would be
welcome.

You know, I find this strange. I use gnupg at work, and we are required
to use Outlook. GnuPG works just fine with Outlook.

I think you need to also add an "-lgslcblas" argument when you link 
things to create the executable to pickup the addtional library. 
Depending on the complexity of a given application you'll have 
numberous -L directives if you have a number of directories containing 
libraries in them. You will also have numberous -l<library-name> 
directives as well one for each library your using functions/methods 
from in your code.

Subject: [PLUG] emacs tip - comment syntax and highlighting for text conffiles
Message-ID: <1038906875.18500.108.camel@bittersweet.intra.hegbloom.net>

Many conffiles use "#" as a comment character.  They are not written in
any normal programming language, and so there's not a built in font lock
mode or comment start expression defined for them...

At the end of any file, in emacs, you can place a "local variables"
section that sets up some buffer-local variables for that file.  This
feature is documented in the manual:

http://www.pdxlinux.org/cgi-bin/info2www?(xemacs21/xemacs)File+Variables

The similar is also true for GNU Emacs, of course, and I gather that
even Vim supports a similar feature.

There is a buffer local variable called "comment-start" that is used by
the "comment-region" function.  When it's set, you can highlight a
region, and use "M-x comment-region" to comment that section off.  "C-u
M-x comment-region" will uncomment it.

Another buffer local, font-lock-keywords, controls syntax highlighting. 
You can read it's extensive documentation by using "F1 v".

So here's what I do for conffiles that use # for comments that I also
want highlighted as comments, to make them more visually distinct:

# Local Variables:
# mode: text
# comment-start: "# "
# font-lock-keywords: (("#.*$" 0 font-lock-comment-face t))
# End:

I also like to put:

(define-key global-map [(control ?\;)] #'comment-region)

... in my startup file.  (~/.xemacs/init.el)  That binds C-; to the
comment-region.command.  The mnemonic is that ";" starts a comment in
Lisp, the native language of the emacsen.

Whoever wrote that misunderstands the purpose of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  That
environment variable is used at runtime by the dynamic linker, not at
compile time.  You can find out about it in the "ld.so" man page.

I am working on this right now.  If anyone wants a search engine for
anything, whether it be a web site, man pages, email archives, .doc
files, .pdf, .ps, what have you, Swish++ looks to be the one to use!  It
can even output the search results as XML of some sort.

Message-ID: <5.1.1.6.0.20021203184216.02abecd8@pop.net-yan.com>

Hi All Folks,

While viewing web mails on a website such as lycos.com, yahoo.com, 
hotmail.com, etc. clicking their attached documents will start 
'AbiWord'.  But unfortunately some documents created with MSOffice could 
not be read exactly in AbiWord in its original form, particularly, a 
table.  The document must be read in OpenOffice to maintain its original shape.

Kindly advise how to change the link to start OpenOffice instead of AbiWord

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212030835550.25476-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Has anyone seen this behavior before?

  I accessed a couple of Web sites earlier this morning with Opera-6.0.3
with no problem at all. Then I shut it down. A few minutes ago, I fired it
back up, went to a business site, and it started to just close up on me.

  The first time, I was scrolling down a page (with the thumb on the
vertical scroll bar) and it was gone. Another time, it just went by itself.
Once, it quit when I clicked on a link.

  I've not seen this happen with this, or any other, application before.
It's a bit annoying (of course) and I see nothing in the process list that
suggests what might be causing the problem.

Any suggestions?

Rich

I have a chance to end up with a Dell Inspiron 2650 for a *very* low

appears they're letting all three happen at once.

I have until tomorrow to make the order, though, so am a bit rushed in
researching information on it.  Do any of y'all have one?  Is there
anything you just can't stand about it?  Anything you just absolutely
love about it?

linux-laptops.net didn't have any information on it yet, and my googling

I had a Dell Inspiron of recent vintage at my last place of employment and 
mostly hated it.  It was chock full of bleeding-edge, windoze-specific 
hardware and wasn't very stable under either Linux or Win2k.  I was also 
involved in setting up several other such laptops within the company and 
there were several serious problems that we never resolved under Red Hat 7.x 
or Mandrake 7.x, 8.x, mostly related to X.  The situation is probably better 
now that XFree 86 4 has been around for awhile and I can't say anything 
specific about the model you're considering.  But I would personally be very 
hesitant before purchasing a new-ish Dell laptop for running Linux.

Just one man's opinion,

Mark

If you are compiling from source, you may need to lower the Word_Threshold 
value in config.h.  I have found that even on the most robust Linux machines, 
the default is too high, which according to the comments, was set for a Sparc 
machine running Solaris.  Also be sure to make sure the defined temp 
directory is adequate.  Actually, Swish++ won't compile until you define this 
variable. 

Also, you can play around with the parameters in config.h, it defines things 
such as what characters are letters, how many consecutive consonants a word 
may have, etc.  This is very useful if you need to tailor the search to fit 
your needs. ( We needed to be able to search for ISBN numbers. )

At my work, we have purchased many Dell laptops over the last few
years. Some have been very solid, but we've had a couple lemons. One
was a refurbished laptop, and we had the motherboard replaced FOUR
times for various reasons, in about a one year period. The last time
they replaced it, they ran some more tests, which showed the
motherboard to be fine, but the memory failed. They replaced that too,
and now it is finally a stable machine.

One other machine had a problem with the pointing stick causing the
mouse to drift. It was intermittant, and when it started drifting, it
would accelerate. Soon it was like a video game trying to click on
"Shut Down" or any other settings.

We have always purchased the expensive ($300) extended 3 year onsite
warranty for most of the business laptops, and we've had to take
advantage of the warranty on several of the machines. However, the
other 2/3 of the Dell laptops we've purchased have been great.

We have set up Linux on three or four of them, and haven't had any
major problems.

The Inspirons are designed more for the gamer or hacker or home user,
with less reliability but lots of bells and whistles. The Latitudes are
business machines, generally leaner but more stable and tested.

Here are the steps you need to follow.

1. Making Libraries Accessible to the Linker: As root, add /usr/local/lib to 
/etc/ld.so.conf and then execute the command "ldconfig".  I believe that 
someone already suggested this to you.  For more details about this step, 
read the ldconfig man page.

2. Compiling Object Files: When you compile the object files, make sure that 
your header files are accessible to the compiler by including -I arguments 
that specifiy where to find the header files.  Here is an example of 
compiling

gcc -c my_program.c -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/gsl 
-I/home/my_home_dir/my_other_include_directory

This will produce an object file called my_program.o.

3. Linking Object Files into an Executable File: In the linking phase, you 
need to make sure to tell the linker which libraries to use and, if 
necessary, where to find them.  The -l and -L flags specify the libraries and 
their possible locations, respectively.  Here is an example of a command to 
link the object files my_program.o, function1.o, function2.o into the 
executable file my_program

gcc -o my_program my_program.o function1.o function2.o -lm -lgsl -lgslblas 
-L/usr/local/lib/gsl-1.2 -L/home/my_home_dir/my_other_library_directory

The flags -lm, -lgsl, -lgslblas tell the linker to search the math, GSL, and 
GSL BLAS, libraries, respectively, for functions that are not found in the 
object files.  The specific libraries that you use for your task depend on 
which BLAS libraries you are using with GSL.

There are other compiler and linker flags that you might eventually find 
useful also.  See the gcc, ld, and ldconfig man pages for details.

It probably won't be fun but I strongly suggest carefully reading through the 
sections of the gcc man page that pertain to these flags as well as the 
ldconfig man page.  You should probably also consult a Linux/UNIX-specific 
book that describes how to use gcc because you seem to be missing the big 
picture.  For a good, quick overview, I suggest reading parts of the "Linux 
Programmer's Reference" published by Osborne or reading parts of "Beginning 
Linux Programming" published by WROX, just to take 2 somewhat arbitrary 
examples from my book shelves.

First off, I don't speak for my large blue employer.

There are flavors of Linux that run on pSeries. I don't think IBM is
behind any of them. They have ported Linux to all of their platforms -
except pSeries. In lieu of supporting Linux on p they have tried to make
the native Unix (AIX) as Linux friendly as possible. However, in September
they announced a *plan* to offer it:

http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,538818,00.asp

That said, Suse, Yellow Dog and Rock all offer Linux distributions that
run on RS6k hardware. I know *nothing* about Rock. I do know people who
have installed Suse and Yellow Dog. I don't think there is a port of
RedHat.

pSeries is just a marketing label. Last year all IBM RISC boxes were
magically transformed into pSeries boxes. In similar fashion all AS400s
became iSeries, all PCs became xSeries, and all 390s became zSeries. I'm
not sure it does you any good to know what model it is (unless it is a
really old one) - you just need a distribution built for PowerPC.

Hope that helps.

Hi Rich,

The only time I've seen this behavior was on an old laptop with very
little RAM.  After the swap partition filled up, applications would just
disappear when they couldn't get any more memory.  Maybe it is time to
run memtest86?

Just $0.02 worth

Derek,

  With 328M RAM I've not run short before; there's also 250M swap. Nothing
like this has happened before, and why only the one app?

  Strange, but computers do odd things at times.

Thanks,

The problems I've had with opera in the past came from glibc or from java.
Did you download the static version?
If not try that instead.

I've pretty well looked up hardware info on the laptop - the 2650 sports
the GeForce2 Go graphics chip and i810-compatable audio... so I'm good
there... I haven't found specifics on the NIC, but generally NICs have
decent support.  I'll keep digging on that NIC, for sure, before
purchase.

I appreciate the input and will keep it in mind....

I've heard a lot of that - laptops being shipped dead.  I can wait,
though, for a replacement... since this deal is so darned good.  What I
don't hear a lot of is laptops that are shipped good dying in a year...
which is a good thing.

I have that problem on an old Toshiba ... a very old one.  It can get
interesting.  This model, unfortunately, doesn't seem to have the
pointing stick - just that ackward and hard-to-use touchpad.  Optical
mouse it is!  <g>

As I'm a poor college student, I'm going with the 1-year base warranty. 
Do you know, if at the end of the warranty, they'll off you an extension
for a bit more than you would have paid at first?

That's what I like to hear.  :-)

As I said in my last email - the NIC is about the only thing I'm unsure
of.  If worst comes to worst, I can pop in an old 10BaseT NIC I have
floating about (from the Toshiba mentioned above - which is currently
dead).

Well, I'd classify myself as a hacker/gamer/home user, definitely.  :-)

Thanks for the added input, I appreciate it!

Since there's an onboard NIC, you probably aren't too concerned
about the PCMCIA bridge, but it's worth checking into just in case.

You never know when you'll get the itch to go wireless.

Messages such as the one quoted below have been very
helpful to me in using the GNU Scientific Library, as
you can see from what follows:  

[rtk at openlinux rtk]$ gcc gslfirst.o -o gslfirst
gslfirst.o: In function `main':

J0(5) = -1.775967713143382920e-01

This is a cumbersome way to do it, however, so I am
hoping that advice such as that contained in the
message below will allow me to avoid typing so much.
The provider of a different package advised users to
put the library search path into LD_LIBRARY_PATH in
.profile_bash, but I don't seem to have such a file at
all.

I have the itch already!  It is itching really bad!  But my wallet keeps
me in check.  <g>

I just found a great page, via a groups.google.com search to an article
that mentions a mailing list that contains a link to the page.  :-)

http://www.angelfire.com/linux/chowells/

I'm relatively certain that PCMCIA compatability issues are rare... and
if there were any with this model, a google search on it would have
turned them up.  This guy had one problem with it, but has a fix for it
(he replaced the internal modem - I don't use modems, they suck).  :-)

Ok... now just find some cash!  lol

They suck, but they'll let you check your email when you go home :)

PCMCIA problems are usually chipset dependent.  Another good page to
check is pcmcia-cs project page on sourceforge:

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Hi all,

If you write long documents, use Linux, and need an outline processor, you 
might like the new VimOutliner 0.2.0. It uses VI keystrokes plus some 
enhanced commands to perform outliner functions such as indent, exdent, 
collapse, expand -- either by individual trees or outline wide. 

Because it's based on quick-editing Vim, VimOutliner is an incredibly 
productive outline processor.

If you used the old VimOutliner, you'll like this one much better. 
VimOutliner 0.2.0 has a vastly improved collapse/expand that truly hides all 
subservient headlines, without the irritating "shadow lines" of the previous 
version. Also, this version has color coded levels, a simple install script, 
and several other features.

Although it's not part of the VimOutliner 0.2.0 distribution, I've written a 
VimOutliner to LyX Book Class converter, and if anyone wants it I'll be glad 
to slap the GNU GPL on it and make it available on the VimOutliner website.

If you use Linux and need an outline processor, check out VimOutliner.

I wasn't suggesting that you were running out of memory, but that maybe
you should rule out a bad memory stick, it is easy enough to test.

Randal gave me another idea; I have had to "killall java" (I have
blackdown java installed) several times, though it was related to
Mozilla, not Opera.  My machine would start to get sluggish, I would ps
-Al and see a LOT of java processes, one or two would be hogging the CPU
cycles.  "Killall java" and my machine is back to normal.

Tim,

  Allow me to recommend the O'Reilly book "Managing Projects with make" by
Andrew Oram & Steve Talbott. If you put all the long lines in a Makefile you
don't have to keep retyping them (or using the bash history to search for
them).

The next thing that you need to learn is how to create a makefile.  Then you 
won't have to retype the flags repeatedly.  At the very least, you could 
create a script to perform the compilation and linking.  I again suggest that 
you consult the references that I mentioned or some other similar text.  
There is also an excellent online manual for make at

http://www.gnu.org/manual/make/html_chapter/make_toc.html

The file is called .bash_profile not .profile_bash.  If a file is missing, you 
can always simply create it.  Of course, advice about bash is only relevant 
if bash is your shell.  If so, there is an excellent man page on bash.  You 
might want to read it too.

  Tried this just now: nothing died. Mozilla's just fine and opera just
started this. Think I'll pull down the tarball again this afternoon and
re-do the installation.

I know a lot of people are running Linux on the newer RS/6000s, but I wondered
how feasible it might be to run Linux on the older machines that are still out
there. An old work station from, say 1996 for example -- how is the driver support?

May I assume that you are aware that the "comment-start" (and syntax
highlighting) are already set up for Perl?

cperl-mode is very good, isn't it?  It is one of the best programming
modes.

For managing the compile and linking process so you don't have to type 
extremely complex commands yourself you should learn how to use "make". 
This is what large non-IDE based projects tend to use to manage the 
build process. 

You can write a script to do the basic steps for your and I've seen this 
done on projects by people that didn't want to make the effort have an  
an effective build process. That's not to say I haven't written my 
share of shell and/or Perl scripts that help in the build process but 
the scripts were invoked by "make" typically. 

I've come into some fairly large projects and the standard way they were 
building things up until my arrival entailed running a script which 
blew away all of the .o and .so files and then recompiled everything. 
It only took 30-60 minutes each time anyone wanted to compile the  
system depending on how may other people were recompiling everything 
concurrently. 

I spent my first week or so on the project creating Makefiles which 
depending on the number of files that changed the rebuild time would be 
a matter of 1 minute or less time if only a few files needed to be 
compiled and and new executables created. Certainly if some top-level 
.h file changed that all of the C/C++ files were using was changed 
required everything to be recompiled and so the build took quite a bit 
longer.

Learning how to use "make" and creating a working "Makefile" is not easy 
as it requires you to learn how to write your own makefiles which 
require you to specifying targets and prerequisites.

Either use the browser's helper applications configuration, the Gnome
control center file associations one, or fix it in /etc/mailcap or
~/.mailcap.

On a Debian GNU/Linux system, /etc/mailcap is managed by the
"mime-support" package, which provides "update-mime".  It has a man page
which describes it's use and tells something about the format of entries
in a mailcap file.

Indeed - I still live at home....

And we not only have DSL, but we have DSL with a static IP and no use
restrictions aside from the 512/256 capping - I can run any server I
want to (and I do!)  :-)

The only time I might need a modem (school has wifi, btw) is when I'm
off at tech school - after basic training (going in to the USAF Reserves
soon).

So sad.

% apt-cache search memtest
hwtools - Collection of tools for low-level hardware management
sysutils - Miscellaneous small system utilities.
memtest86 - A thorough real-mode memory tester.
memtester - A utility for testing the memory subsystem
kernel-patch-badram - Kernel patch allowing to use partly-bad RAM modules

"memtest86" must be run instead of the OS.  It is booted either from a
floppy, or from the boot loader (Lilo or Grub).

You made one glaringly obvious omission; likely the distro with the
largest number of packages available, the simplest and most trusted
upgrade option, and largest support network:

http://www.debian.org/ports/powerpc/

http://www.personalized-story-book.com/debian/Woody_ibm_chrp_net_inst_HOWTO.html

Hey, if IBM starts selling pSeries computers with Debian GNU/Linux
preinstalled, that would be most excellent.  Way cool.  I bet the folks
who worked on the powerpc port would be quite thrilled.

Yes, just yesterday, with Mozilla.  I had just upgraded Java from
j2re1.3 to j2re1.4, and the symlink in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins that
leads to the actual plugin had not been updated to point to the new
location.  Since it had not changed, Mozilla still thought it had a Java
plugin, registered during previous runs.  Whenever I would click on a
link to a page with a silly java applet (see below) it would crash.

Apparently, Mozilla does not have very good exception handling in that
area.  I need to report this as a bug...  Both against Mozilla, and
against that j2re1.4 Debian package.  (It tries to run the
"update-alternatives", but that had no effect for some reason I could
not quickly deduce.)

The solution was to fix the symlink and restart Mozilla.  Accessing
"help | about plugins" told me that it now could "see" the version 1.4
java runtime plugin.  Access to a page with a silly java applet worked
again, with no crash.  Check your setup, by listing plugins, etc, and
looking around in the plugin directories, and see whether all is in
order.  Perhaps the crash you are experiencing has similar causes.

Silly java applets...  Why does http://www.portlandstatebookstore.com/
need a java applet for the menu on the left?  An HTML table and perhaps
a little javascript (ecmascript) would have sufficed quite nicely.  When
I click on that java applet, the entire page refreshes anyhow, so it's
not like it makes the interface any nicer.  It's not even a tree menu! 
(and a tree menu can be done without a Java applet anyhow.)

That's right!  I've got all my projects on *SCSI* disks, and use
Makefiles for nearly everything! ;-)

More seriously, I believe you can bypass the need for adding anything
to ld.so.conf or LD_LIBRARY_PATH by using an -rpath specification to
ld.  You can do this from a gcc command-line by using the -Wl,<foo>
option.  See docs for details.  I've never used this feature directly,
but I've seen reference to it scroll past on many a "make install" for
GNU and similar packages.

I will assume, at least for now, that the Debian package's maintainer
has chosen an appropriate value for that threshold setting.  I have
changed the temp directory via the conffile, since "/tmp", on drizzle,
is a tmpfs, and the comments in the sample conffile indicate that it can
use up a lot of space when a lot of files are being indexed.  The /tmp
tmpfs is configured to a 128Mb size limit, and that might fill up.

What exact change did you make to make it work for ISBN numbers, please,
in case I want to index BibTeX files with ISBN numbers in the entries?

Do you know if the filters get run more than once, so that, for
instance, a .ps.gz file gets first unzipped and then has pstotext run on
it, or will I need a special filter set up for .ps.gz files?

I've found the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable useful in certain situations 
where the directory paths were slightly different between our 
development/test systems and the actual production servers. Being able 
to specify a LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable meant that our system would still 
run since all of the our required shared libraries could be found at 
runtime.

I changed the value of Word_Min_Vowels (The minimum number of vowels a word 
must have in order to be indexed) to 0.  I read somewhere the source code 
that any character that is not a vowel (defined as aeiouy) is considered a 
consonant.  Since our ISBN numbers are all numeric, with a few exceptions, I 
had to lower it to 0.  I also raised the Word_Max_Consec_Consonants (...this 
many consecutive consonants) to 10.  These changes were made to index 
bibliographic information for about 10,000 scientific titles that are often 
searched for using the ISBN, the title, or a committee member's name.  We 
have not encountered any adverse effects but changing the vowel/consonant 
values.

I am not sure on this one, but would be curious to know if it does require a 
special filter.

Have you tried the normal things when browsers misbehave? i.e. clear the

Make sure there's nothing hanging around in /tmp that will cause it to 
fall over.

Do you know about:

I wonder if their software is available, or if you have told their

Remember the emacs tip of the day I posted last night re "local
variables"?  Well, another very useful buffer local variable is
`compile-command'.  Use it like this if you like, for simple one file C
programs:

// Local Variables:
// compile-command: "gcc-3.2 -o alloc_thread -O2 alloc_thread.c -l pthread"
// End:

What that does is give a default command for when you use "M-x compile".
That also can be used for non compiled stuff where you run a script or
something, though more often what you want then is
"after-save-commands.el", part of XEmacs.  (M-x customize-variable,
After-save-alist)

RH 7.2 NIS server, HPUX NIS client.

Everything worked until I updated to the latest RH ypserv to fix a
memory leak.

All services on the HP fail with:
ftp: ftp/tcp: unknown service  <-- or respective protocol name

ypwhich displays correct server, I've restarted NIS on both server and
client.  Remade the maps, reverted to an old Makefile in /var/yp on the
server...

`ypcat services |grep ftp` displays just fine on the HP, but it won't
use it!

I even removed all blank lines in /etc/services on the server (maybe an
old problem but it showed up on google:groups).

Anyone?  My only workaround at this point is to add "services: files" to
each HP's /etc/nsswitch.conf file, but that would be a lot of HP's to
touch.

Due to the expected high attendance of our MWVLUG meeting, we just
received approval to move our meeting location. It is only a few blocks
from the original location and has a much larger capacity.

See the directions page for details:

    http://www.mwvlug.org/map/directions.shtml

Our new meeting location is in the Owen Building Room 101.

We will have representatives available to escort attendees from the
Huvland Building to the Owen Building for the first half an hour of our
meeting. We will delay the start of our meeting by 10 minutes to give
everyone a chance to be there for the start.

I'm impressed that you ever had Mozilla work with Java.  Mine crashes
every time I hit an applet.  Fortunately there is a "make Mozilla
unstable" checkbox available that I just uncheck.  (Those wacky developers
have labelled it "enable java".  :-)

Alas, I have not had time to pick through the massive Mozilla codebase to
try and track down the problem.  It's rare that I really need Java,
anyhow.

A good site for diagnosing Java problems is:

That was actually the only way I was able to fix it. There's something 
about HP's implimentation of YP/NIS that's just not right.

Everyone else (Solaris, AIX, IRIX, FreeBSD) that I'm playing with, plays 
nice. HP-UX doesn't like what RH is serving.

I also haven't been able to (ever) serve the auto.home map to my HP-UX 
boxes. I have to keep a local copy on the HP-UX box for it to work.

Sorta defeats the purpose of NIS, doesn't it?

It sounds like you've already decided on the warranty, but for lightweight, abuse prone devices like laptops a longer warranty is good. I've got 3 (out of 10) expensive paperweights in a drawer at work waiting to be cannibalized. They aren't Dell but they all failed between 13-24 months after purchase.

It's definitely a risk... yeah... but the three-year warranty was
something like $200 more, which increase the cost of the system by over
25%....

I'll re-evaluate it if/when I'm offered an extended warranty at the end
of the one year... I know Toshiba does this, perhaps Dell does, too.

Can you find anything in the "ypserv" ChangeLog or NEWS that might

I installed Mozilla 1.2 and the Blackdown j2re1.4 from Debian packages. 
Mozilla from unstable, and Blackdown Java from:

deb ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/devel/lang/java/blackdown.org/debian unstable main non-free

I think that with a fresh install, the needed symlinks will be created
as advertised.  For some reason, it did not work right when I upgraded. 
I've reported the problem to the maintainer.

The symlink is:

karlheg at bittersweet:~
% ls -l /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/java*
lrwxr-xr-x    1 root     root           35 Dec  2 20:17 /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/javaplugin_oji.so -> /etc/alternatives/javaplugin_oji.so
karlheg at bittersweet:~

lrwxr-xr-x    1 root     root           59 Dec  3 13:31 /etc/alternatives/javaplugin_oji.so -> /usr/lib/j2se/1.4/jre/plugin/i386/mozilla/javaplugin_oji.so

If you are installing from RPM or non-package manager binaries, creating
the similar symlink should enable Java to function, I would guess.

Eric,

When you use up2date would you type up2date -i kdebase-3.0.5-3.i386.rpm
or kdebase-3.0.5-3?  I tried both and I was told that the package wasn't
available or was already installed.

You'd think that they'd be able to make up their minds.  :-)

TIA,

Jim

Odd. I've been successfully running Java in mozilla since ca. 0.92. 
True, it sometimes barfs bigtime, but that's the rare exception, not

Just a guess... try: "up2date kdebase", and see if it figures out the
latest available version for you.  That's part of the point of using it,
most likely.

It does.  As long as you have a filter set up for .gz, and another for

News to me.  I didn't elect for the extended coverage when I bought my 
Satellite 1715xcds two years ago.  Last week a few of the keys stopped 
working so I checked the literature that came with the thing.  Since this 
was their bottom-of-the-line model, the factory warr was only 1 yr.  (Other 
models were 3 yr.)  I called tech support and played dumb, sure enough 1 yr. 
  They suggested I take it to a factory authorized yadda.

Traced the problem down to an intermittent connection in the keyboard cable. 
  Online prices were ~$80 so I decided to try and fix it.  After I came home 
with some mod wire, it must have decided I was serious and started working 
again.  Shrugged and put the screws back in.

Moral:  The extended warr would not really have been worth in in my case, 
but if the lcd fails that's another story.  The thing only cost $899 so an 
extra $200 for the extra coverage seemed excessive and I'm no road warrior 
and it has a pretty easy life.  If I were ever to lay out $2000 for a 
notebook, I would definately get the extra coverage, but it sounds like your 
deal is keeping the machine in the "disposable" range.

Could you please provide more detail information.

Previously I made following changes

On KDE
 From Control Center -> File Browsing -> File Associations -> Application

Delete AbiWord leaving only OpenOffice behind

from /etc/pluggerrc:

Changed as follows

application/x-msword: doc, dot: Microsoft Word Document
application/msword: doc, dot: Microsoft Word Document
nokill exits: oowriter "$file"
repeat swallow(AbiWord) fill: AbiWord -nosplash -geometry
+9000+9000 "$file" >/dev/null 2>/dev/null
repeat swallow(PCFileViewer) fill: sdtpcv "$file"
repeat swallow(PCFileViewer) fill: /opt/SUNWdtpcv/bin/sdtpcv
"$file"

Tested with

Konqueror
yahoo.com MSOfficeXP doc can be opened with a click on it and read correctly
lycos.om MSOfficeXP doc died on clicking
hotmail.com MSOfficeXP doc can not be opened on clicking

Mozilla
yahoo.com, lycos.com, hotmail.com
MSOfficeXP doc can be opened with a click, with unknown application, and 
could not be read correctly in original shape (a table)

Thanks

I tried this before but decided to give this solution another go.  Same

(50+) on a system call:

select(6, [4 5], NULL, [4 5], {0, 10000}) = 0 (Timeout)

before the abort and I haven't figured out why yet (sorry, not quite up to

Two comments for you.

Be sure you have the necessary X development stuff installed.  On an rpm
machine, the bare minimum would probably be XFree86-devel.

Perhaps the build process uses xmkmf/imake.  Be sure to closely follow
the build instructions.

I wonder if Konqueror reads the /etc/mailcap or ~/.mailcap files also,
or if it just pays attention to the "file associations" from KDE?  I
know nothing about plugger.

On a Debian machine, it's in "xlibs-dev"...

In order to find out what package to install to get those tools, again,
on a Debian system, go to http://packages.debian.org and enter the name
of the program in the "contents search" box.  It will tell you which
package owns that program, so you can install it.

Actually, since unixODBC is already packaged...

OK.

I need to see the current state of a progress file in another users
home space. The whole tree is world readable, but I get "permission
denied".

The user is seti (only does seti stuff, and is not a user in the
traditional sense).

permissions on /home/seti is 744, and is at least that on all the
other files and directories below that. But I can't read a file that
is not in the /home/seti dir. How come?

Please clarify.  Can you provide the output of "ls -la" there, etc?

Bruce,

The /home/seti directory will need need to have the execute bit set 
for group and others, e.g.,

  chmod go+x /home/seti

The reason is that you need to be able to 'execute' the directory in 
order to read the files in it. The same thing will be true of 
subdirectories in the /home/seti tree.

In other words, 744 needs to be 755.

We both have Netgear routers (RT-311) between the DSL modems and the hub

Has anyone else done this, and what sort of experience did you have?

Message-ID: <1039031462.4993.256.camel@dereklinux>

Hi All,

This may be slightly off topic, but I need to be hit with the clue stick
(again).

At home, I have a Cisco 678 DSL "modem", with two "real" ip addresses,
one for a server and one for my firewall.  Recently I've noticed much
more activity than usual (both the WAN and LAN activity lights are
flashing several times a second, all of the time).  At first I just
thought that my son wasn't logging off of the on-line game he's been
playing, but this morning after he left for school I noticed that it was
still being active.  I checked, and he had logged off.  

So, I fire up etherreal to capture packets on the private side of my
firewall.  Nothing showed up besides the usual ARP and DHCP stuff. 
Well, that is odd, so I installed and fired up sniffit on the other side
of my firewall and the only thing it sees is the ssh connection that I
used to connect to the box.  I did create some traffic and saw it, so I
know that the sniffer is working.


My question is:  What could be causing this activity and is there a way
to confirm this?

I called my ISP, and they can offer no help, except to call the phone
company, saying something about an ATM heartbeat.  I think that a
heartbeat to the "modem" would not show up as LAN activity though and a
heartbeat of several each second is going overboard, even for Qwest. 
Anyway, I'd rather ask this fine list, I think I will get much better
answers.

TIA

Russ,

I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "talk to each other" but here's
what I do.

I have a Linux workstation at work, and several Linux workstations and
servers at home. My home network is behind a D-link router, which
forwards port 22 (ssh) to my home Linux workstation. That way, while at
work or at a friend's house, I can ssh into my home Linux workstation,
and from there ssh into all my other Linux boxes.

I can send or receive files remotely using scp as well.

I believe that you can mount NFS shares over the internet, though I
haven't tried it yet. I hope this helps.

-Scott

There was an article in Sys Admin Magazine that talked about setting up 
secure NFS using OpenSSH. I haven't tried this myself yet but thought I 
might want to try it in the future so I saved the URL away.

I haven't done this yet, but have looked in to it... and PPP over SSH
looked like the best way to do it to me.

Google about for information... it requires two *nix boxen, one at each
end... to connect things together.

I set up something like this not too recently.  We had a remote office in
Florida, and I connected them to our network via IP Tunneling.  

Here's a quick article from Linux Online.

My son has a network in his house.

I have a network in my house.

Both are connected to the internet.

I'd like them to be able to talk to each other, like a VPN.

We both have Netgear routers (RT-311) between the DSL modems and the hub 
serving each network, so I can forward ports from the router to a 
computer inside the router.

Has anyone else done this, and what sort of experience did you have?

What package did you use?

Thanks in advance for any information.

Are you still using OAV/ClamAV with it?  Unless Clam split their
definitions from OAV, there could be your problem... OAV is rarely
updated.

*One* glaringly obvious omission??? It appears that I also omitted Genntoo
and Mandrake. Further, I was wrong about RedHat:

Thanks though, I didn't know about the Debian project.

How much you want to bet this is "off-shore" third-world labor?

Of course, the third world economic model is very lucrative, so we're
seeing it here more and more.

It appears (from this article, next page) that GRE is better for my 
purposes. I have several Windows machines on both networks that also 
need to pass traffic, and it sounds like ip-in-ip may not handle all 
that that needs.

  I just received another one of these: "Subject: High Skilled Developers
For Your Every Need". This is the second or third that have come in here
over the past couple of weeks. What struck me is the Microsoft focus,
despite what they write about covering _all_ OSes. I think they mean all
flavors of Windoze. Anyway, I just keep reporting them to the originating
ISP. Now, however, I've added the subject line to the postfix header_checks
filter.

Enough,

While we're on the subject of spam, here's one that found my Plug list 
address:

The first one. Took them long enough. I don't use this address anywhere else.

Tony,

  While India has been in the forefront in the past, this spam tracks back
to China. That's where the (ahem!) "remove" Web site is located. I got one

OK so * generates what is needed

$ for i in * ; do echo $i | sed 's/ /_/g'  ; done
1_2

so I think this works

$ for i in * ; do if [ "$i" != `echo $i | sed 's/ /_/g'` ] ; then mv "$i" `echo $i | sed 's/ /_/g'` ; fi ; done

$ ls 
1_2

why is this?

Thank you

Doesn't dd spit out something like

xxxxxx+0 records in
xxxxxx+0 records out

at the end of the run? Would this be passed to md5sum also, is it standard

Calling `mdsum -b` might be the better test.

mdsum -b /dev/scd1
md5sum -b $IMAGE_PATH/$IMAGE

Sorry for this vague request.  I am looking for some direction.

An associate of mine and I are trying to help someone identify the optimal path
for creating a custom-built email system that will forward / route lots of emails.
 She had assumed the solution would be deployed on Microsoft technology.  As
a Linux newbie, my instinct is telling me the would be better served to deploy
this solution on Linux, but I don't know enough about email systems or Linux.


Can someone give me some pointers on why Linux would be superior for this?

Thanks in advance....

Subject: [PLUG] Red Hat 8.0 Performance Comparison
Message-ID: <3DEEA3EF.C5B94556@attbi.com>

I spoke too soon the other day when I thought that the new kernel I
compiled for my desktop machine combined with some additional memory
solved that machine's performance problem. Alas, it still feels too slow
to me.

I won't call this a benchmark, since that implies more accuracy in the
measurements than I tried to make, but here are the results of a simple
test I did with two machines, my laptop, and my desktop. The purpose of
this post is to see if anyone can point me towards the information I
need to learn how to improve the performance of the machines under Red
Hat 8.0, especially the desktop machine.

The test involved starting a terminal, starting Mozilla, and connecting
to http://jigzone.com. On right side of their home page, there are
several images which, when clicked, take you to a page with a java app
that turns that image into a jig saw puzzle. For the "benchmark" part of
the experiment, I typed "date" in the terminal, clicked on the 48 state
US map puzzle, waited for it to finish loading, and typed "date" on the
terminal again. Then I computed the difference in time between the
output of the two "date" commands.

I repeated the test on each machine running Windows 98SE and using the
time command in a DOS window. In each case, the installation of Win98 is
the one provided by the manufacturer of the machine. In the case of the
Red Hat installations, the one on the laptop is the default installation
from the Red Hat CD's, while the one on the desktop is the kernel I
compiled the other day specifying that I have an AMD K6-2 processor, and
leaving all the other options in their default condition.

The laptop is a Thinkpad 390X, with a 400 Mhz Celeron and 96 Mb of RAM.
The desktop is a special from Bi-Mart a couple of years ago called an
Avatar VBOX, and has a 550 Mhz K6-2 with 192 Mb of RAM. The numbers in
the table are the elapsed seconds between running the date, or time
commands.

		thinkpad	avatar
Red Hat 8.0	23		35

Win 98SE	13		11

I would expect the avatar, with the 550 Mhz K6-2, to run a little bit
faster than the thinkpad, with the 400 Mhz Celeron, and under Win 98SE
that is the case. I'm curious about why the results are 1) slower under
Red Hat 8.0, and 2) why the avatar is so much slower than the thinkpad
under Red Hat 8.0. Hopefully, I'll learn what options to tweak when I
next compile the kernel so I can get better performance out of the
avatar.

Any ideas?

Stuart,


Your instincts about using Linux as a mail server are correct. The
primary mailing application for Linux--Sendmail--has proven itself for
over 25 year in enterprise and academic use.

But you don't have to be a large business to run it. I use Sendmail for
as my personal email. Mail gets sent to a server in the garage running
on an AMD 450.

There are other excellent email servers available. Exim is is an
example.

I would like to just offer you two things overall. 

First, I built a Sendmail mail server for a company I used to work for.
I left the company before that server (also running FTP, File and Print
services) ever saw a minute of downtime.

Second, when you use Exchange server for your mail system you will run
into several issues. Chief among them is trying to gel Exchange 2000
Server's Active directory paradigm with older clients.

A company I know of with 1600 seats is learning this the hard way. It's
a mess. Believe me.

The primary argument against using Linux for your mail server is a
perceived lack of group collaboration tools. Look to Ximian's Connector
to solve this. Evanite Fiber did, and they've never looked back. 

So overall you can really heap on the reliability and reduce
infrastructure entanglements by using Linux.

Oh, and by the way, you can use a lot less machine to do the same work
primarily as the server does not need to run the GUI or unnecessary
background processes.

Look, Microsoft's done here. Email services are increasingly becoming a
commodity. I have solid information to the effect that large
organizations are making pointed migration plans to Linux. Put this
email in your ``predictions'' subfolder: your customer will look ``so
yesterday'' within five years if you go with MS. That's a promise.


Best,


Cooper

  You'll get a lot of answers that cover every possible aspect, and then
some. I'll try to focus on a few, key issues to get you thinking. Once you
have more specific questions you'll get more specific answers. It would also
help to understand the setting of the "custom-built email system that will
forward / route lots of emails". But, let me offer some thoughts.

  A linux based solution offers these broad advantages: choices (lots of
'em); no viruses; detailed control that's easy to understand, implement and
maintain; low cost (none); runs on all sorts of hardware; easy to keep
secure and upgrade; and works as you work.

  The linux mail system consists of several categories of components. I
assume that you're considering a business system (and not a spam factory!)
and you'll have your own domain name, static IP address and mail server. The
mail server (or Mail Transfer Agent, MTA) is the heart of the system. The
old workhorse is sendmail. Newer, more powerful and easier to use options
abound. I use postfix (as do many others), but there's exim, qmail, smail
and others. The MTA will screen messages it receives before passing them on.
It then sends the message on to the next stage. For outgoing mail that's the
recipient's MTA, for incoming mail it's the MDA.

  The Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) does the local routing (or forwarding, if
necessary) to the recipient's mail box. procmail is the most commonly used
MDA; I don't know that else is out there, but I'm sure there are
alternatives.

  Once the message is in a user's mailbox you'll find a plethora of Mail
User Agents (MUAs). In the Microsoft world there's Outlook/Outlook Express,
Eudora and (perhaps?) Netscrape or mozilla. In linux you have choices for
text-based MUAs (pine, elm, mutt) and graphic-based MUAs (sylpheed, mozilla,
Kmail, evolution, whatever Gnome provides, and many others). Each user can
pick the MUA of her/his choice and it doesn't matter to the system.

That's a start,

Rich

Mail under Linux is stable. Mail on Microsoft is not.

I ran the perl5-porters list (over 2,000 subscribers) a couple of years 
back on Linux using a P75 with 80megs of memory.  The response time for 
the entire list was about 10 minutes for the average message.  (That is 
very fast for a mailing list that size.)

The *only* reason people run Exchange is if they need the calender 
functions or they like spending money for software that corrupts itself.

And remember, you cannot buy just one Exchange license.  You have to have 
another for the backup server.  When Exchange corrupts the user e-mail 
database (which happens about once a month or more), you cannot restore a 
single user at a time.  You have to restore to a seperate Exchange server 
and use voodoo-like import/export tricks to get the mail moved over.

Microsoft for mail is just BAD. Plain and simple.

Dick,

Yeah. I have a couple: 

1.) There's a real-time kernel patch by Robert Love that I have found
improves foreground processes significantly. The new kernels have the
option for the patch built into the compiler options, labeled,
``Preemptible Kernel'' under the ``Processor Type and Features''
section.

2.) Make sure that you are using DMA access by default. This is also
compiled as an option in the kernel. With newer kernels, this option is
checked by default.

3.) Make sure support for your motherboard's IDE chipset is compiled in.
You can find a list of supported chipsets (select the one you need)
under the ``ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support/IDE,ATA and ATAPI Block Devices''
section.

4.) See this great article from IBM for manipulating your PCI bus.
Basically, you allow each device full rights to the data bus for a
longer period before it has to relinquish control to another device. In
your case, pay special attention to your video card and Ethernet
controller settings:

http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/l-hw2.html?dwzone=opensource
  
5.) make sure your computer is using swap. Given your memory upgrade I
doubt this is the case but it never hurts to check.

6.) If your video card uses an Nvidia chipset then be sure to download
and install the kernel modules (drivers) for it and configure X11 to
take advantage of them. I can offer you an X11 configuration file that
will work with this hardware, just copy and run!

Oh, yeah. I've personally witnessed this an it really is bad. You get a
database of over a thousand users and it is just error-prone and
tedious. Basically a very poor design by any standard.

When I first read about what sort of hoops an admin had to go through to 
restore an Exchange server I was totally baffled as to why any 
organization would invest money in such a system. Email has become a 
fairly important business tool and I can't belive that any company 
wouldn't want that system running on the most reliable platform 
available i.e. Unix or Linux IMHO.

The original Exchange database was built using Access database code.  They 
were supposed to have replaced that, but sometimes I wonder.  (Access was 
never meant to be multiuser.  Multiple CPUs make the problems even more 
fun...)

The reasons for this are that people who understand the problems and 
technologies are no longer the people who actually make the decisions.

A number of years ago, computers became "buzzword complient".  Managers 
could impress their friends by the size of their IT budgets. (Not that 
they knew how to use it...)  They were told by Microsoft sales people that 
in order to be "cool" they had to run Exchange for mail.  Because they 
wanted to be in the "in-crowd" and wanted to make their golfing buddies 
think that they were clued, they told their IT staff to use it or else.  
When told just how much their Microsoft habit was costing, they went into 
denial. They would just lash out at the IT department until they went away 
and/or gave up.

There is no good reason to run it, but so many upper management types have 
been conned into doing it it is hard to get them to change to something 
stable.

Karl, 

What's with the recent increase in spam?  My wife may like this, but I'm
a little dubious about the results promised since it's not from a peer
reviewed journal.  ;-)

TIA,

Jim

Your instincts are correct, Exchange is a horrid quagmire. Just Say No.

MTAs to look at:
qmail
Postfix
Exim

qmail claims to handle the highest workload on the least hardware. I like 
Postfix. All three are first-rate.

Sendmail, in my opinion, is for people who like doing things the hard way. 
Plus it has a history of security problems. 

Webmail:
Squirrelmail
Linux Webmail IMP  <-- IMAP

POP/IMAP
courier
qpopper
qmail-pop3d

Procmail and Fetchmail for filtering and delivery options

Already-built products with groupware features:
SuSE Linux Email server  <-- very good browser interface, don't need 
standalone mail client
SuSE Linux Openexchange
Bynari Insight
Caldera Volution

Friends don't let friends use MS Exchange. :)

The responses to my question have been great -- thanks everybody for your input.
 I work for a company that's very MS centric, but every once in a while I need
to put my foot down. Looks like I've got the data to back up my position.

There was talk that the email project was going to involve a fair amount of
custom development. I'm not sure why, but if that is the case then I can site
the breadth and quality of development tools available on Linux as an advantage
as well.

I had one piece of spam, not related to PLUG, back on November 21st.

Indeed. No doubt skilled third-world coders are being rounded up by the
dozens even as we speak, bound for slave labor software sweatshops where
they'll be forced to program against their will. If only we could figure
out a way to pressure foreign governments to pass legislation
banning these human rights atrocities, those poor souls might find a way

I don't know.  It was blocking it, and now suddenly it's getting
through.  It's as if somebody is accessing the admin interface and
automaticly approving the publication of the message!!!

If anyone is doing this, when it says "suspicious headers", READ IT. 
It's probably SPAM.

Hello All,

Sorry if this has been covered, I just re-subscribed. A friend of mine
just installed RedHat 8.0 and is getting manpages that have garbage
characters in them, such as:

A search on RedHat's site didn't produce anything. Anyone have any

I cannot make a comparison between the Microsoft platform and Linux, or
between Linux and commercial Unix, since I have only experience with
Linux.  I do have some experience with both Sendmail and Exim 3 however.

Sendmail
========

Sendmail has a bad reputation amoung some, and a good one amoung
others.  Many people believe that it is difficult to configure.  On a
recent Debian GNU/Linux installation, Sendmail is a lot easier to use
than it is on the Red Hat setup I examined.  The reason for this is that
the Debian maintainer has put an aweful lot of work into making it easy
to use.  If you must use Sendmail for some reason, then Debian is the
platform of choice for it.  (But look into Exim!)

There is a pretty decent "sendmailconfig" script that asks some
questions and builds a starter "/etc/mail/sendmail.mc" for you, for
instance.  That happens automaticly when you install the package.  In
most cases, you don't need to do any more configuration at all.  Also,
there's a very good "/etc/mail/Makefile", and a "sendmail.conf" used by
the init.d scripts as well as some admin commands provided by the
package.  It allows you to configure multiple queue groups, and whether
to run Sendmail from inetd or as a daemon, and to run the queue from
cron or by the daemon.

If you never muck around with sendmail.cf (which is a major taboo since
that breaks upgrades) and only edit the sendmail.mc, trusted-users, etc.
files, you can just type "make" and it will rebuild the sendmail.cf and
all the lookup tables, then prompt you to restart the daemon.  To do
much customization, you will need to read the bat book.

Exim
====

Exim 3 (and Exim 4) is a lot easier to figure out.  The Sendmail book is
quite thick.  It's configuration language is turing complete...  You
could probably implement Sendmail Lisp in it.  The Exim book is much
lighter and less daunting.  There is also a great online documentation
for it that puts an index in a frame on the left and the text on the
right.  I think that Exim does everything you'll ever need and that
since it's a lot easier to figure out, you're better off with it.

It was fairly easy to get Spamassassin and Amavis + a virus scanner
working under Exim.  RTFM, and it's not hard to figure out.

Others
======

I never did figure out qmail, and it's licence is restrictive, so it got
crossed off the list right away.

Postfix seems to be popular amoung the Mandrake people -- I gather that
it's what MD installs by default.  Similarly, Exim is popular on Debian
machines, since it's their default mailer.  On Debian, Exim "Just Works"
for the vast majority of installations, with no configuration required
beyond the questions asked by it's postinstall script.

I found Postfix to be slightly more difficult to figure out that Exim. 
I never really could get Postfix to work right wrt header rewriting and
intranet domain masquerading.  Supposedly, Postfix's multi process
design is more secure than the monolithic Sendmail or Exim.  The
argument is that Sendmail runs as root, and so if there's ever a buffer
overrun exploit, you can get rooted.  Exim runs as "mail" on Debian, and
IIRC, Postfix also runs as a non-root user, as does qmail, so if they
get cracked, at least the attacker is not given root.

I personally have not ever gotten down and dirty into the source code of
any of them, so cannot really make any FUD free statement regarding
actual system cracker proof security.  I think that actual cracking of
servers is relativly rare anyhow.  Some people are way too paranoid
about that issue than they need to be, IMO.  But that's how they make a
living.

IMAP
====

For IMAP, I've used only uw-imapd, since it Just Works out of the box
with standard login accounts.  It is what is used on
drizzle.pdxlinux.org.  The only configuration I had to do was to have it
allow plain passwords (but only over SSL) and to put the folder base in
the user's "Mail" directory to keep $HOME tidy.  A simple "apt-get
install uw-imapd" gets it up and running in short order.

For a dedicated email server where mail is expected to be kept on the
server and accessed via IMAP, and where the vast majority of users will
not have login access to that server, then Cyrus IMAPd is generally what
people use.  It is non-trivial to get up and running...

Cyrus IMAPd (via SASL) can be set up to obtain authentication data from
an Active Directory or LDAP server on your LAN, if you install the right
packages.  (Everything you need for that is part of Debian GNU/Linux,
already built and ready to install and use. You'll need libpam-ldap and
libnss-ldap, I'd guess...  I have not actually finished my research in
this area and have not yet configured a Cyrus IMAPd.)  It can also
obtain authentication data from the standard passwd database, or with
the kerberos system.

Cyrus supports the SEIVE server side mail filtering language.  I believe
it is the first IMAP to do so.  I have not used it...  Cyrus also lets
you set up shared mail folders.  Such a folder could be used to
implement rudimentary shared calendaring, by using the normal
peer-to-peer but emailing to a shared mailbox where everyone must check
in and update their Evolution calendar manually from the messages left
there.

There is also a suite called Courier that looks promising.  It has SMTP
and IMAP, plus calendaring, and web mail.  All are available from
Debian, so you can quickly try them that way if you like.  (Did I
mention that I'm a Debian advocate?)

Mail Server
===========

If it was me, I'd start with a minimal Debian 3.0 (Woody/stable)
install, and go with Exim 3 and either Cyrus IMAPd (harder) or uw-imapd
(easier, less capable) depending on how many users, etc.  I would
install Apache 1.3, optionally with libapache-mod-ssl, and Squirrelmail
for web email access.  Since Squirrelmail accesses the mailboxes via
IMAP, it should play well with other mail user agents that also use
IMAP.  I have not done much wrt testing uw-imapd with multiple clients
on the same account concurrently...  I would imagine that Cyrus is much
better in this area.

Because the decisons are made by non-technical people who have no clue. 
It looks good in the store, and for a while seems great.  It's not until
you own it for a while that you notice the things that are wrong about
it.  They spend money on it becuase doing so is part of the whole
corporate business paradigm.  It's not about getting the goods and
services to people, it's about maximal profit and one for you two for
me.

Email could be a much more important business tool if a) there was
better tools for dealing with it, and b) people actually learned to use
those tools.  Doesn't it just bug the shit out of you when some dope
PRINTS an email?

Sounds like something is wrong with the "groff" setup.  Perhaps if you
purge and reinstall the man and groff subsystem, it will fix itself. 
You may need to do the rpm equivalent of "dpkg --purge --force-depends
--auto-deconfigure" to get them to uninstall (and purge conffiles).

That's bad - though not as bad as one place I worked where people would
print out web pages, attach a distribution list, and forward it through
the interoffice mail.  I shudder every time I think about that.

My second "favorite" peeve was that more than one person would attach a
3 line memo written in Word to an email, rather than just writing it in
an email.

Could be the infamous RH8 locale issue- what man page reader is your friend 
using? Try using yelp or konqueror (man:foo). See the RH8 release notes on 
disc 1, or on redhat.com, they contain answers to many vexing issues.

If it comes back as `linux' (it probably will) then you're golden. If
not, set the TERM variable to a `common denominator' value:

export TERM=vt100

or

All of the ideas presented thus far in the thread have merit.  I've used 
many of them and set up a few.

One that I did not see mentioned (though it wouldn't be the first time I 
missed a post in my plethora of email) is IPSec.  I assisted in setting 
this up once between three locations, each with their own unique 
192.168/16 address schema.  Once it was set up, we could browse the 
private LAN of the other two locations as if they were local.

I did find it difficult to set up even with the GUI provided by the 
package.  Perhaps it was because I didn't really know what I was doing 
at the time.  *shrugs*

I used a now defunct firewall product who's source code has been eaten 
up and destroyed by a large corporation who fears Linux.

  The latest issue of "Linux Journal" (with Star Drek on the cover) has an
article on using FreeS/WAN, the (a?) linux implementation of IPSec. It's
free (as in beer), secure, wide-area networking.

It sounds like you've done all the right things.  It's strange that you
don't see the traffic on the public side of your firewall.

Does your modem's link/activity indicator for the "PC" (firewall) side
show activity?  If you only see the activity upstream from the modem, you
probably will never be able to tell what it is without your own DSL
analyzer.  ;-)

If you see activity downstream from the modem, perhaps your sniffer isn't
working as well as it might appear.  Are you running SniffIt on a Windows
system?  I've had problems sniffing non-IP traffic on Windows before.  

Were you sniffing from your firewall itself, or from a third system
connected into the network?  I've had problems with some firewall software
dropping packets before they get to the sniffer (this was on Solaris,
though).  If it's a third system connected to the network make sure your
hub is really a hub.  I've seen LOTS of "hubs" that are really using
switching hardware, sometimes in bizarre ways (i.e. Linksys).  It
sometimes helps to power-cycle your hub right before sniffing.

Unless you can see the traffic, it'll be real hard to figure out what it
is.  ;-)

Yes, the LAN light shows activity VERY shortly after the WAN link lights
up.

I'll try not to be insulted :)  If there is one thing I've learned over
the past couple of years is NEVER EVER EVER connect a Windows box
directly to the Internet.

The box that runs SniffIt does not have any firewall rules running while
I do the sniffing.  I really want to see those packets.  Good point
about the hub, but I ran "known" traffic through it and was able to see
that.

This is very true.  Thanks for the ideas.

Does your ISP do any sort of spam filtering? I can't say that I get all 
that much spam through my ATTBI address. For dialup when I travel I 
have an account with Verizon.net and I get 100s of spam emails at that 
address. One time I went a month without checking for email and I had 
more than 600 emails that were all spam. I'd like to find another ISP 
for dialup that at least does some spam filtering on their email 
servers as it would appear that Verizon.net doesn't do any.

AFAIK, the dhcp server is not enabled, and I know I haven't made any
configuration changes to it.  Another argument against this, is that if
dhcp was enabled, it would be in conjuction with NAT, so the address
pool would be private addresses, and the only addresses the "modem" can
see are public, which means that the 678 can't see any addresses in its
DHCP pool (if it does have a pool).

Thanks for the suggestion, process of elimination helps too.

I have an unfiltered DSL account through Easystreet. Wide open pipeline to the 
Internet. I could have a filtered account if I wanted one, but I don't want 
one, for several reasons:

-good practice for filtering and proxying
-keeps my spamrage fresh
-Spamcop is fun

There are a couple of parking garages that are close and pretty reasonable.
Also, if you can find street parking, it's up close, too. At that time of
night, should be fairly easy. You can also, if you feel adventurous, take
the MAX or bus. Bus stops right in front of Smith.

You might try a restart on the hub, or even try a different brand
hub.  I've seem some truly strange things with consumer-grade hubs and
packet capture such as every-few packets go to all ports, but most
don't.  Only the uplink port goes to all other ports, etc.

This may not be possible if things have to keep running, but you might try
connecting the modem directly to your sniffer PC via a crossover and see
if the activity blinks continue.  That would eliminate any possiblity of
hub-related silliness.

Another option would be to try a different sniffer just in case some wierd
sniffer bug is involved.

Not that I want you to point fingers, but do you know what brands are
the worst and what ones are the best; as far as "hub-like" behavior
goes?

This is a very good suggestion, I think I can get away with it if I stay

Another good idea, have you had better results from one particular
sniffer?

"Russell Evans" <revans at e-z.net>:

> $ for i in * ; do echo $i  ; done

the important thing to know is when the shell splits a
string into a list of "words".  The 'for' statement
iterates over a list of words.

globbing happens after a statement has already been split
into a list.  the '*' in the list gets replaced with a list
of filenames, so the for statement will iterate over all the
filenames.  spaces in the filenames don't matter.

backquote substitution happens before a statement gets split
into a list.  the output from `ls` is a stream of text, just
a single string.  the shell then splits that string at every
space to get a list of words.

if you have filenames with spaces, then the splitting won't
be what you want, because the output from `ls` does not
unambiguously delineate filenames.

this is a ubiquitous problem that arises out of the unix
philosophy that output from programs should be usable both
by humans and by other programs.  there are some awkward
cases like spaces or newlines in filenames that never got
resolved well, mainly because they used to be rare.

I've had especially poor luck with Linksys in this regard.  I've had good
luck with Netgear and 3Com hubs, though I've heard reports from people
using 3Com hubs of packet capture problems.

I think many times it depends on who made the chips inside the hub and
which revision you were lucky enough to get.  Nice, eh?

I've had good luck using tcpdump to capture and ethereal to
display.  Using ethereal to capture would probably work identically since
they both make the same libpcap calls.

Another hub-related issue: usually dual-speed hubs only send all the
non-broadcast traffic to other stations running at the same
speed.  I.e. don't try to sniff 10base traffic with a 100base card unless
you force it down to 10base.  Note that most DSL modems run 10baseT.  The
crossover cable connection will fix this problem.

One other thing I thought of-- some NICs don't like to go into promiscuous
mode.  (They say they went into promiscuous mode, but they really
didn't.  Your simple test should have caught this unless you were sending
the traffic to your network monitoring station.)

I've see that at PSU in the computer lab.  They'll print web page after
web page, single sided, pages with a grey level around 10-20%, and leave
most of them overflowing into the recycle barrel.

These are perfect examples of what I started talking about in another
branch of this thread...  "non-technical" people often don't really know
how to use the computerized office tools very well.

They just plain don't know any different.  They've never been exposed to
other, better, ways of doing things.  All they've ever used is Windows,
and they don't have a computer at home.  They are not given admin
priveledges on the computer they use at work, and know very little about
what actually occurs inside the computer.

Bash and Zsh both support array variables.  They don't quite work the
same in both shells.  I found that they work better in Zsh... that was
quite some time ago and I've not written huge amounts of shell code.

One problem I had was due to my misunderstanding of globbing, I think. 
I thought that filling the array with the results of a glob would make
it split the file names on spaces, and give me an array with broken file
names in it.  Perhaps now if I went back, I could make that script I
tried to write that day work.  I might not even need the array variable,
though perhaps I might, if I don't want to glob more than once for a set
of files I process twice or something.

MAX Park-n-Ride is probably the best choice.  You'll have a lot less
trouble finding a parking slot, and I don't think it costs anything
either.

Take MAX to the Library, and the Streetcar to PSU.  Tri-Met has a great

  There are two issues here, Karl, and you've hit on one of them. There is a
skill set in using computer applications -- and the computer system itself
-- that should be part of everyone's capabilities. We don't let people
drive a car or a boat or pilot a plane without some level of instruction and
demonstration of competence in the mechanics of using the equipment. I agree
that this needs to be taught to _everyone_. (I don't want to see them all
programming, but that's a different thread.) Those of you in the CS/IT/MIS
and SysAdmin professions see the results of letting anyone behind the wheel
of a computer. The results can be quite ugly.

  The second issue is different and, for some of us, of equal or greater
importance than is the first issue. Teaching someone the mechanics of using
a word processor does not make him/her a writer. Similarly, learning the
mechanics of the appropriate applications does not make one an artist
(graphic or fine art), statistician, spatial analyist or page layout guru.
On this issue, the computer is simply a tool that takes the mechanical
drudgery out of the intellectual task. It allows more focus on the expertise
just as using a four-function calculator minimizes (or eliminates)
arithmetic errors, but it takes different skills to know which keys to push
to get the correct answer.

Is there a non-GUI mode for ethereal?  I really like the program, but it
is a hassle if there is no x-server on the box.  I guess I should figure
out how to dump on the sniffing box, and move the dump to my workstation
for display by ethereal.

That is ugly, and good to know.  The hub is a 10base though, I didn't
see any reason to get a 100base just for connecting to the DSL, and the
10base was priced right.

The traffic I generated didn't try to access the monitoring box, I just

Thank you very much for this information, so much to learn, so little
time.

No, why should it? There are all kinds of reasons for making hard copies, 
that's why we have printers attached to computers.

>Why Everyone Should Learn to Program:

I don't agree that learning to program makes a person a more skilled computer 
user. It's a different skill set. It won't make a person a better accountant, 
or writer, or better at analyzing and managing data. Where it may be useful 
is teaching people to think analytically. But it won't make them better at 
using applications. Training in the applications does that. 

In fact, I argue the opposite: that having a broad set of skills and life 
experiences makes programmers write better programs. How can you write good 
code without an understanding of what will work well, and be practical? How 
can you write good code if you have contempt for your users? How can you 
write good code without understanding the profession you are writing for, 
whether it be accounting, publishing, graphics, etc? Kind of like building a 
house without understanding what the people who live in them will need. Which 
is the standard, very few houses are designed sensibly. Just like most 
computer programs.

Just run a tcpdump to a file ( tcpdump -w filename). You can then either
read it using tcpdump -r filename or open it in ethereal for more in
depth analysis.

I agree, but isn't it easier to upgrade the computer or software than the user? Beside the MS sales rep said the next version of their software will correct all user idiocy related bugs. I think it's called, "A piece of bark and a charcoal stick, Version 1.0"

It's easy.

On the sampling system:

# tcpdump -s 2048 -n -i eth0 -w /tmp/packetcap-001.tcpdump
.... capture for a while ...
^C

On the nice, fancy X-Windows system:

# scp user at sampling:/tmp/packetcap-001.tcpdump /tmp/.
# ethereal -t a -r /tmp/packetcap-001.tcpdump &

I'll let you refer to the appropriate man pages to see what the options
do.  One comment-- the "2048" is quite oversized for an ethernet network,
but will catch really strange things should they happen.  ;-)

Your driveway.

Downtown is very well-serviced by public transit.  Smith Center is just a
few blocks from MAX and only a block from the Streetcar.  Plenty of busses
go up Broadway and nearly every Tri-Met bus goes down fifth or sixth
avenue.

Where do you live?

Check out the trip planner at <URL: http://www.tri-met.org/ >.

Umm, I don't know, may be MAX's tendency to shut down for a couple of
hours every now and then? I ride MAX may be once or twice a month, and I
ran into it twice this year.

Well, if one is not used to travelling on mass transit, it can be an...
*interesting* experience.

To put it mildly, there are some very freaky people that ride the bus.

Sorry, couldn't pass up bait like that.  ;-)

It's a double meaning.

Adventurous as in "I've never done that before, let's try it!" and...
Adventurous as in "Have you seen some of the people that ride the MAX during
non-commuting hours????"
I've ridden the MAX after hours, and I've used that exact phrase :)

Really?  I'm usually MUCH more shockedy by and afraid of the people who
ride DURING commuting hours.

But then again, maybe I'm one of those people that freak you out during
the off-hours.

I like to use the big block size PSU parking structure bounded by
SW 6th and SW Harrison and SW 7th and SW Hall.  I think it is named
"PARKING 1" - how original.  In any case, they charge $2.00 for the
evening, but they stop charging to 7:00 PM - so if you come to the
meeting a couple minutes late it is free.  At least, I've never
gotten a ticket for parking there after hours.

Well, you likely hit the bus at different times than I.

I rode the bus to school for about a year, all said and done.  The times
when most people were at work.  So the people who were on the bus when I
was there were those who had no jobs (ie; welfare lifers) and couldn't
afford cars, period.

There was quite a different crowd when I would ride home around 1700.  

But, I'm sure that's all a coincidence, we don't want to be un-PC and
realize those without jobs are wierder than those with jobs.  :-)

I ride it every day and I rarely get caught when it has a problem. Guess
you're just unlucky. Not indicitave of how the MAX usually runs.

Like me? I ride it and I'm not freaky. Actually, there are a lot of people
that ride it who aren't freaky. It's "public" transit. That's why you
*might* run into "freaky" people. You have to interact with your fellow
man. For shame.

Wow. All of them were? No kidding. I was probably one of them back from
93-97. Of course, I was on the bus because I was probably going from
full-time college to full-time work. Or visa versa. I didn't realize I was
a welfare lifer. Who knew.

Or maybe some of the other people are just visiting. Or maybe they work
odd hours. Or maybe they're going to college or maybe....??

Or make generalizations that only poor people on welfare ride the bus or
train. I skateboard, bike AND ride the train to work. I must be on welfare
too. Although, last time I checked I was still gainfully employed with a
college degree. Who knows, maybe generalizations aren't always right.

Downtown *is* well serviced by public transit, unfortunately my
suburban neighborhood is not. If Max came to my doorstep, then I would
be glad to ride it. But that's okay, I did the next best thing: I drove
my gas-hog import minivan and parked a 1/2 block away, and got there in
1/3 the time. :)

Anyway, my son and I enjoyed the meeting. Well, he was a little bored,
but he enjoyed it anyway. I wish I could have got a chance to meet more
people, but it's hard to sneak an 11 year old into a bar. :(

I don't attend PLUG meetings because it is an inconvenient location no matter 
what means of transportation I use. Coming from Beaverton, it's a hassle, 
driving or transit. I'll choose a 20-minute drive in my gas-hog import 
minivan over a 60-minute multi-transfer smoke-belching-bus/MAX adventure any 
day. Especially for an evening meeting. Yeah, I know the streets o Portland 
are safe as the streets of heaven, and all those scary people riding the Max 
are really angels at heart. Like the SOB who tried to pickpocket my backpack, 
or the gang o hoodlums who were set to rob all the passengers, until a timely 
flood of cops changed their plans. It's starting to smell like Seattle 
transit, every public facility up there stinks of urine. I ride transit at 
least once a week, don't give me lies about how great it is. 

My van gets pretty good mileage, 18 in town, 25 on the highway. It hauls 
camping gear and pulls a boat quite handily, as well as a heavy power 
wheelchair. My sweetie needs the wheelchair. I know, she should figure out 
how to ride a bicycle or something, but the wheelchair is what she chooses to 
use.

I'll hang my head in shame in a daily 30-second ritual over my evil ways.

How can I design better software if the people I'm writing it for have
no real concept of what computer programming is, or of what really goes
on inside a computer?  What I mean is, that if they have some knowledge
of the process and of what is possible, they can provide better
requirements process input and feedback.

Everyone should learn to program, but not everyone will become a
professional programmer.  Every driver should know how a car works, but
not very many will ever become mechanics or automobile engineers.  Many
more will learn a little about maintaining and tuning their auto than
will become design engineers.  Not every Emacs user will hack Emacs'
out-of-the-box internals.  Every Linux user should be capable of
troubleshooting and providing useful bug reports and design feedback,
but not all will develop the skills required to actually fix the
software internals when they are broken.

The other thing is that the most useful software is designed to be user
extensible with an embedded programming language of some kind.  Every
Emacs user should learn some Lisp and be capable of using it on
occasion, for instance.  The tool is just orders of magnitude more
useful then.  An accountant should be capable of performing some
customization of the software used to perform that job, provided it
supports that.  In this sense, learning to design and write programs is
application training.  Knowing how to do it, and expecting that good
software will allow this sort of end-user customization is another thing
that learning to program does for a computer user.

You are grossly exagerating!  Tri-Met is nowhere near as aweful as that,
in my experience.  And from Beaverton, it's a straight shot from the MAX
to downtown, transfer to the streetcar or a bus and to PSU.  It will
take very little longer than driving, if you park at the MAX station in
Beaverton.

It amazes me that people think that 18 is "good mileage".  That totally
SUCKS.  Good mileage starts around 30 or 40.  Unfortunatly, most
vehicles don't get good mileage.

Oh, and thanks for the "fresh air", drivers.  Mighty kind of you.

They tell me it has a firewall, but I dn't know what the RCA box in the line is. 
Anybody out there know?

That's the problem, though isn't. If the meetings were somewhere closer to
Goose Hollow it would make it easier for us Beaverton folk. But then
there's this whole city of Portland out there (NE, SE, N). So I guess it's
as central as it can be, really.

I like it. I don't think it's a lie to say it's a great system. Am I

Oh please. You have your reasons for needing a car. Fine. But why belittle
the system and those of us who use it? Does it make you feel like your

I'm not an expert on the hardware, but I seriously doubt it has a
firewall. I have ATTBI (of course, perhaps not the same RCA Box) and when
I used to use Windows with Zone Alarm and Black Ice Defender on another
box here those apps used to light up like crazy with hack attempts, virii,
worms, etc.

What's the model number of the RCA box?

I am not exaggerating. Come to my house and call me a liar to my face. I know 
how long it takes to ride transit from my house to downtown. It's about an 
hour, with one transfer from the 62 bus to the Max. Driving to the park and 
ride shaves off 10 minutes, tops. Driving back roads to avoid freeway snarls 
takes 25 minutes from driveway to the Smart Park by the library. On the 
freeway, with good traffic, it's 20 minutes. 

I know exactly what kind of scary experiences I have had. There have been 
many. You'll refuse to believe me, of course, but that doesn't change what 
I've experienced.

It's good for a van, and it's better than the 5-8 mph buses get. When you find 
a vehicle that gets 30-40 mpg, and meets my needs, I'll buy it. I mean it- 
find me a vehicle that will hold a power wheelchair lift, wheelchair, four 
passengers, tow an 1100-pound boat, and get 30-40 MPG. I'll trade in right 
away.

I guess you haven't looked at what comes out the exhaust pipe of a bus. The 
exhaust from my van is heck of a lot cleaner. Have you ever pondered where 
the electricity that powers the Max comes from? It ain't magic- everything 
has a price, and a consequence.

That's all fine and good until you get a filename with a newline in
it.  Yes, it can happen.  Yes, you don't want to be creating a
security hole or breakage when it does.

I'd suggest instead:

perl -e 'for (@ARGV) { ($new = $_) =~ s/ /_/g; rename $_, $new unless -e $new }' *

As far as I know the RCA box is just the cable modem. It may or may not 
have a port filtering capability. I've had cable modem service for 
nearly 3 years and I don't know anything about my RCA modem. I've never 
been able to figure out how to connect to any sort of online 
configuration for it or anything.

It's a war zone on ATTBI's network with script kiddies and others 
probing around for open ports like crazy. I've only had Linux and 
OpenBSD systems connected to my cable modem and have always used a 
firewall.

I do squelch some of the firewall logging to ignore the many port 80 
probes as well as all of broadcast noise that goes along with a cable 
network. The broadcast noise is the worst with my firewall filtering 
out many 1000's of packets.

Sorry I can't catch your advice.  Did you refer to "Control Center" of KDE

Control Center -> Web Browsing -> Netcape Plugin

Under "Plugin" Tab   there is no such item "pseudo URL"

Yeah, no kidding. I am a lot more scared of the people driving the cars
than I am of the people on the bus. People on the bus can't just
accidentally kill someone just by not paying attention.

No, you're not stupid, but I don't agree that it's a great system,
merely a comparatively pretty okay system.  It is a very poor system for
those that live in the suburbs; Tri-Met serves the close in Eastside and
the (very) close in Westside very well, get beyond that and expect a
bus/max trip to take 2 to 3 times longer than a car trip would (not
counting finding parking at your destination).  7 years of riding the
bus into downtown from Beaverton showed me that.  Even worse is trying
to get from one suburb location to another - my commute from my house in
Beaverton to PCC Sylvania was 1.25 hours (including the 15 minute walk
to the bus station), when I could get a ride that time was shaved down
to 15 minutes.  Even worse than *that* is getting from one suburban
location to another suburban location on the opposite side of town, my
daily commute from Beaverton to beyond the Airport one summer a few
years ago now ate 4 hours of my day, every weekday; by car it would've
only eaten 1 hour of my day.

Poor suburban service (which is admittedly expensive to run) compounded
with the fact that Tri-Met keeps reducing the usefulness of their maps
by making them more and more diagrammatic and less and less
representational (particularly irksome because it's a completely
avoidable issue) making it harder to find out how to get to a location
using the bus, as well as completely different schedule layouts
depending on if you're looking at them online or on paper, poor night
and weekend service, and NEVER being on time, make Tri-Met look just
okay in my eyes.  And I'm the type of person that doesn't mind (that
much) when somebody sits down next to me who's body odor could be
measured in parts per ten, or planning in the additional time it takes
to ride Tri-Met; forget about it for most people.

About the diagrammatic maps: Because their maps are now diagrams rather
than maps I have to use a real map along with the Tri-Met route diagrams
to try and interpolate where the bus ACTUALLY goes and how close that is
to my destination; were I just driving I'd often be there by the time I
figured out what bus(ses) I have to take to get there.

A significant reason for moving to NW PDX was so I could avoid the bus
completely and walk to work downtown.

The RCA box is the cable modem.  It's just a layer two bridge with an IP for 
managment purposes.  There is NO security built into this box.

Your customer will need to purchase a hardware firewall (best) or a software 
firewall.

He means open Netscape and enter "about:plugins" into the location box. 
It will display plugin information for Netscape. I think you can also go 
to "About Plugins" in the Help menu (it's there in Mozilla, not sure 
about Netscape).

The RCA box is the cable modem itself. ATTBI doesn't provide any sort
of firewall. One thing to check: if they have ZoneAlarm installed and
turned OFF, but still not pingable, uninstall it. Oftentimes ZoneAlarm
will go haywire and block all connections, even when it's supposed to
be disabled.

The actual problem (and I have verified this myself) is the local being
set to UTF8 (probably en_US.UT8) and the culprit is the LANG variable,
setting it to just en_US should solve the man problems.

That looks surpringly like a perl script that used to be distributed
with perl, except that you could pass in the perl code to execute
to create the new name from the old :)

Subject: [PLUG] Proprietary Software & the GPL
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212060851080.5304-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Mark Rosen's column at the rear of the latest (Jan. '03) "Linux Journal"
started me thinking about application development on linux. I know (or have
strong reason to believe) that there are no lawyers, attorneys, or
cousellors among the denizens of this list, but some of you work for ISVs
so you may have some insight useful to me.

  The context is this: I'm porting a C library from DOS/Windows to linux
with the original author's permission. My original intention was to use this
library (or libraries, actually) as the core of approximate reasoning models
I would develop to address environmental concerns on behalf of clients. I
would write the models (in C) and use gtk+/gdk for the UI. Because the
application would not be distributed I had no concerns about license issues.
However, I can now see advantages of selling copies to regulatory and
resource agencies, and training them in the proper use of the models. I have
no intention of releasing the whole application under the GPL; it will
remain proprietary.

  Where I'd appreciate your _thoughtful_ comments are on these issues: as
Rosen wrote, linking to a GPL'd (or LGPL'd) library does not modify any of
that original, open source code so it's almost certainly not a derivative
work. Using GNU tools (make, gcc, etc.) to build the models also does not
make my applicaton a derivative of each or any of them. So I can keep my
models closed source and proprietary because the only included open source
components are the libraries I used to create my own application interface.

  This seems to be established, but I don't know for certain. The terribly
expensive, excessively poor quality accounting software I purchased a couple
of years ago is certainly closed source and propietary although it has both
a ncurses interface and a tcl/tk interface. Other proprietary applications,
I'm sure, also use these multiplatform tools for the user interface without
license violations.

  As a very litteral, straight-line thinking scientist, Rosen's contention
that using a library is not creating a derivative from it makes perfect
sense to me. If, for the purposes of my application, I modified or enhanced
gtk+ or gdk, then I would have created a derivative work, but not otherwise.

  Considered opinions, please.

On an ethical level, I think that you are doing a huge disservice to the
community that you so often speak highly of. Why do you think it is
moral to not release back to the community in the same spirit that the
GPL libraries and tools were gifted to you? The community only works if
people give as well as take. Are you only a taker or do you want to put
your money where your mouth is? Consider whatever potential revenue that
you may lose as payment for the many times you used other people's work
gratis. Sell your training and implementation on these tools to the
agencies if you need a revenue stream.

Just to give you real world results. I drove to work (downtown from SW 
185th) yesterday, and rode the Max today.

Driving:

Left house: 8:15
Arrived Work: 8:47
Elapsed: 32 minutes.

This included the time walking to my car, parking in a garage, and 
walking a block to work.

I avoid most of the Sunset parking lot by driving through Beaverton up 
Canyon Rd. So I don't get on 26 until Sylvan. I'll hate that when they 
turn on the meter at that on ramp. Talk about planned congestion.

Max:

Left house: 8:06
Parked car at Willow Creek: 8:15
Max arrives: 8:23
Arrive Pioneer Square: 8:53
Arrive Work: 8:59
Elapsed: 53 minutes.

This includes the time walking to my car, the time walking to and 
waiting for the Max, and the time walking the four blocks from the Max 
to work. The trip outlined here is typical for a morning, rush hour 
commute from Willow Creek transit center. I've been doing this for 
almost 4 years.

I don't think nearly a doubling of my travel time as "very little longer 
than driving".

Obviously, you've never worked for a real developer, or with 
professional programmers.

Many of the programmers I've worked with have no idea how to set up 
networking in any OS. Many of the programmers I've worked with know how 
to write code, but couldn't install Windows by clicking "Next" all the 
way through the installation. They are quite good at what they do. 
However, they choose to write code, not spend time learning how the 
interface to set up their system works. Why? Because that part of the OS 
isn't germain to the task at hand. How to plug an IP into Windows, 
Linux, Solaris, or AIX doesn't matter one bit when it comes to the 
application they are programming. Knowing the TCP/IP stack and how to 
access it IS needed. Knowing how to configure the TCP/IP stack is 
irrelevent, as it better work BEFORE the application is installed.

I can set up a network, and install many different OSes, but I can't 
write anything more than a very trivial program in C++. I'm better in 
Perl, but that's because I have a need for perl in my real job.

We've had this discussion before, and I still disagree with you.

The user of the software doesn't need to know how the program works 
internally. Users KNOW what they want, and they will ask for it. It's 
the job of the programmer to turn those requests into code that performs 
the requested functions.

Just as it's the job of the mechanic to fix the squeak coming from "back 
there".

In a perfect world, everyone would be completely self sufficient, and we 
wouldn't have to rely on our fellow human beings to get on with our 
lives. It just doesn't work that way in the real world. When I was 
running the auto parts store I used to help manage, one of the first 
instructions I would give to new employees was, "If you haven't done it 
before, ASK!." I'd rather they ask and get help (relying on me or 
another, more experienced co-worker) than attempt to muddle through 
until they're frustrated, and the customer is pissed off.

Subject: [PLUG] Trimet times
Message-ID: <E18KMf0-0007ou-00@drizzle.pdxlinux.org>

My commute:
NE 60th to Hillsboro (Intel Jones Farm)

Trimet: ~1.5 hours. (includes walk and shuttle times)

Driving: (More subjective)
Morning: 25 minutes - 45 minutes
Evening: 30 minutes - 1.25 hours

Depends on what time I leave in both directions.  Usually driving homeward sucks
more.

Advantages to Trimet: I can read and relax. cheaper than driving.
Disadvantages: Some people annoy me.  ~2 extra hours each day.

Advantages to auto: Quicker. Easier to run errands.
Disadvantages: Other drivers. more stress.

Right now I'm strapped for time so I've been driving.  I would do MAX if I had
the time to spare.  But then again, my Intel contract is up next month so it's a
 non issue then...

If I worked downtown, then MAX is the way to go. slower, but way cheaper when
parking is factored in.

You mean... except for the bus driver, right?

Message-ID: <1428.208.151.243.124.1039197505.squirrel@mail.robbyrussell.com>

If I want to ignore emails and just kill them if they come from say, ".pl"
How can I get the procmailrc to do that?

I tried the following:

#:0
#* ^From.*.pl
#{
#       LOG="(.pl) "
#       :0
#       /dev/null
#}

but it would end up blocking the plug list.
I'm sure it's a simple mistake on my part, I am using the same method to
block specific domains and thought it would work the same with the country
code.

Thanks in advance.

If you think the bus drivers here are bad, you haven't been on a double
decker bus in London.  I've ridden one once (never again).  They whip
around the corners with no regard to anybody (or so it seems) at crazy
speeds...in downtown London, which has narrow streets and cut-throat
drivers in the first place.

Public transit here is cake compared to London, and definitely Rome (where
the subways are so packed all the time that even if you lost your balance
you wouldn't fall over, and transit workers go on strike almost every
week).

As far as I know, there is no firewall in the cable modem, your
customer's RCA box. Mine is a model DCM235, which I got from attbi to
replace the one installed by TCI back when the service was introduced. I
used ZoneAlarm on my Windows machine until I got my router, a Netgear
RT314. I haven't had any intrusion problems since installing the it. The
only problem I do have is that once a week or so, I have to power down
and restart the router. I think it's related to the lease expiring on my
attbi ip address. There may be a way to handle that without going
through the shut down, but I haven't taken the time to get out the
documentation CD and look it up. It's pretty easy to pull the power plug
out, wait a few seconds, and put it back in. That may not be an
acceptable practice for your customer, so you should take that into
account when recommending a solution. There have also been a few
occasions when I've had to pull the power plug from the cable modem to
reset it. The power button doesn't do anything, as far as I've noticed!
I've never pursued why that power cycling is necessary; it's only
happened two or three times in the past year.

If you want more details about the Netgear router, contact me off list
and we'll figure out a way to send you the information.

For me, I have to drive up to Sherwood to catch a bus.  That's 20-30
minutes there.  Then it takes "an hour" (scheduled time) to get up to
PSU.  In reality, it takes between an hour and one and a half hours.

Driving takes 45 minutes to an hour... rarely does it take a full hour.

Me, my suburban (15/18), and my '89 Dodge Spirit (20/30 while eating a
quart of oil every 500 miles) say "You're welcome"   :-)

As Carla was saying, though, find me a vehicle that meets my needs and
doesn't use so much gas - and I'd happily trade in.  Money is definitely
a concern, though, so it can't be too expensive.  The Suburban needs to
tow a 35' RV travel trailer.  It also needs to be able to seat six
adults - and not like what you get with a full-sized sedan, those are
too cramped.

No, they're not ALL scary, but there's definitely a lot more scary
people per-capita, and you're crammed in that bus with a lot more people
per square foot than really just about anywhere else.

You may want to spend some time looking through the
linux-kernel-mailing-list archives because they do a lot of very
similar work, and while Linus is also not a lawyer, his latest
interpretation of the GPL says that linking to a binary only driver
(like from Nvidia) is no protection from the GPL.  So if you release
your interface under the GPL, you could be clobbering the library.

Also, your preferences for license may be moot, since you're porting
someone else's work.  The IP in the library is still the original
authors unless he's assigend it over to you.

There's a great CGI based quiz on the GNU site that may help shed some
light on issues, as well as essays on LWN.

The Kompany has a hybrid model.  I think that all of their products are
open-source, but not GPL.  Many of the products are for-pay.  This
provides them a revenue stream but allows for bug fixing and code
review by others.

I think in short, despite the flames you'll get from those who believe
solely in free software above all, none of us would deny you a right to
make a living but my personal hope is that you take this opportunity to
give back to the free/open software community at large in some way.

Good luck, and may the asbestos in your MUA be thick!

I've heard even programmers need to eat.

It was the GNU developers' right to release the source code to the
things they developed.

It is Rich's right to release the source code to what he develops... but
not a responsibility.  Ethically, how can you guilt him in to releasing
something he has worked quite hard on - then only making money providing
support for it... something that, once the source is out, somebody else
could quite easily do?

Naw, giving away something like that just doesn't make sense.  Perhaps
after he has made a reasonably level of revenue, if he is actually the
license holder (as he is porting from a different library - he could be
held by an NDA or something similar) he would release the source... but
let the guy make a few bucks.  :-)

And, to Rich, I am almost certain you can link against GPL'd libraries
without any problem.  If you distribute the binaries, you may need to
also distribute the source *for the GPL'd stuff* ... and if you modify
any of the GPL'd libraries, you need to release the source, but you
should be able to link against it without concern.

regexp are your friend (or worst enemy)...


:0

{
    LOG="(.pl) "
    # EX_NOUSER = 67 from sysexits.h
    EXITCODE = 67
    :0

Note that the period before the "pl" is escaped so that it's not interpreted
as a regexp (match one anything). Note also that the extended regexp token
for end of a line "$". That's where you tripped. `man procmailrc' for more
details.

p.s.    I should have pointed out that the extra goodie I added would
simulate a bounce. Since you indicated you simply want to ignore the
message, you can remove the setting of EXITCODE.

Ok, I'll try that. :-)

Thanks. One quick question. multiple ifs?
look something like this:
.*\.(pl|tv)$

correct?

Summary:
  + GPL-- don't try linking it
  + LGPL-- you should be OK
  + Using GNU tools-- you are almost certainly OK

This might help:

"The GNU Project has two principal licenses to use for libraries. One is
the GNU Library GPL; the other is the ordinary GNU GPL. The choice of
license makes a big difference: using the Library GPL permits use of the
library in proprietary programs; using the ordinary GPL for a library
makes it available only for free programs."

from http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html.

My understanding is that you cannot link a non-GPL program to a GPLed
library.  The GPL FAQ seems pretty clear on this:

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#LinkingWithGPL

The terms of the LGPL appear to allow linking into a non-[L]GPLed program,
but the legalese in that section is particularly confusing.  It would
appear that it's possible in at least some circumstances to create a
linked program that violates the LGPL.

Using GNU tools to build non-GNU software seems to be an unambiguous
"OK".  http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#CanIUseGPLToolsForNF has
more info.

Generally speaking, even if you accidently violate the GPL, the worst that
is likely to happen is you would be asked to stop distribution until you
can replace the [L]GPLed code with your own.  You would not be forced to
open your source code, mostly because that would be a PR disaster for the
Free Software Foundation and would turn businesses away from the GPL even
more.  (I doubt such a thing would even be enforceable, so I wouldn't
worry too much about it.)

As usual, don't construe this as legal advice and check with your own
lawyers.

I have the single port version of that same firewall (I can't quite bring
myself to call it a router since it doesn't route. ;-)

It works really well as a simple NAT firewall, but is fairly
inflexible.  I keep meaning to replace it with a Linux-based firewall for
better protection and logging but so far my zero-dollar hardware budget
has thwarted me.  Somehow many of my five year old PC parts that I swear

I've upgraded the kernels in RedHat 8.0 . Is it possible or necessary to
remove the previous kernels as I use the newest upgraded kernel. If so
how do I safely remove said kernels from /dev/hda1 that they're sitting
on? In recent upgrade attempts I'm told that there isn't space available
on that partition.I haven't installed the kernel debug or doc pkgs. I
don't really need those for home desktop , do I?

Dirk:

If those kernels aren't in your LILO configuration any more there should
be no problems removing them.

I generally just "rm" the files out of /boot to avoid having RPM do
something stupid and remove a file I want to keep.

My point was that Rich's primary employment (as he has said many times)
is environmental consulting, not professional programming. He relies on
free software to run his business as well as free support from this
list. I don't think all software should be free, but when you are
adamantly against software that isn't open source for your personal use,
but then don't give the community the same consideration that you used
to your advantage, I just don't think it is right. I am pretty sure that
Rich can legally do what he is planning to do, but I don't think he is
returning the spirit of the gift. No one is denying that he needs to
eat, but it seems wrong to take out more than you give if you can afford
to do otherwise.

The problem is that he's PORTING a legacy DOS/Win library to linux with 
the original author's permission.

That author may not WANT his code to be GPL'ed.  The fact that Rich is 
wanting to do this for him is enough - if, later on, the ORIGINAL author 
decides to release his code (and Rich's ported source) to the GPL, then 
so be it.

But it is definitely NOT up to Rich as to wether the ported code gets 
released into the GPL.  All he wanted to know is if it would be okay to 
use GPL apps/libraries/code to create the frontend to his ported app.

What good does it do to not count the time it takes to find a parking
spot (and walk from parking to your destination, though that's also with
the bus).  This is false advertising, Brent!  Do you own stock in a fuel
company, or what?

But that one hour a day you have your hands full -- you must drive the
car and watch the road.  You cannot read a book while you drive.  You
have to worry about where to park the car, about being stuck in traffic,
and about the car payment, fuel costs, insurance, and the Green Guilt of
automobile emissions pollution that you are responsible and accountable
for.

I agree with you on this.  They need a system that overlays the bus
routes on mapquest-like maps, with much greater detail and zoomability. 
It would also be nifty if it had 12 meter Landsat too, so you could view
the arial to get some idea of what to look for when you get there.

Their paper map is a lot better in this regard, IIRC.  You could get a
rough idea of what busses to take using the trip planner, then look over
the map during the ride.

Good for you!  It's better for you physically also.  Walking every day
will help keep you from aging too rapidly.  How far do you consider
"within walking distance"?  For many people, it's 2 blocks or so.  They
are SO lazy.  For me, it's about 5 miles.  And those are COUNTRY miles. 
I walk just about everywhere I go -- I've never owned a car and likely
never will.

  Thanks, Colin. Actually, I don't want to release any of it under the GPL.
_IF_ I end up selling specific-purpose models, then I want it closed source
and for a price.

  That's correct. My concern was linking the gdk/gtk+ libraries for my UI
rather than re-inventing the wheel.

  My point is that there is nothing to give back. I described the software
in my original message and it is so esoteric and of non-general use that no
one picked up on it. I'll bet few understand what an "adaptive reasoning"
model represents. Tools to describe fuzzy sets and to implement fuzzy logic
would have a very limited audience. It's important only to those who
manipulate linguistic variables (a collection of fuzzy sets) to evaluate
inherently imprecise real-world attributes. However, that audience would not
include any SysAdmin or application coder. The code -- in part -- was made
available in 1994 to the DOS/Windows world and we've not seen a big rush to
put out products using it. As a matter of fact, there are very few
practicioners in the business/scientific world, despite the fact that such
models are built into mechanical control systems that are commonly used.

  If I offered it back, almost everyone would wonder what the heck it is,
then shrug and go on with their own life.

Look at all that free time you could be reading a book!  How many books
do you read each month?  I read while I walk also, when it's not raining
out.  I bought a headlamp so I can read at night too.  My joke is that
I'm a knowledge miner... watch your head!

Also, about all that walking?  How's your heart?  Are you in shape?

But when you drive, you remove almost ALL of that free time that you
could be spending reading books, AND you pay a lot more for the ride,
PLUS you are producing POLLUTION.  Yes, the busses burn deisel and
stink, but whether YOU ride it or not, it runs anyhow.  It won't burn
any more or less deisel if you ride it or not (ignoring friction, etc).

If you installed the kernel with RPM, you should also remove it that
way.  It won't remove anything it does not own.

Is this to ditch SPAM?  If so, then I recommend installing
"Spamassassin".  It works VERY well, especially if you also install
"Razor".

  If you read the instructions on www.kernel.org you see that you can build
the new kernel anywhere you want. You should have sufficient room in /boot
for both kernels. You need to point links to the new kernel and modules
instead of the old ones. And, you need to tell LILO or grub where to find
each kernel. Then you can boot either one.

  In real life you don't want to remove a known-working kernel until you
prove that your new one also works flawlessly. Then you can 'rm -rf
/usr/src/<old-kernel> if you so desire.

  This has been a very superficial and imcomplete answer.

I bet there's a signifcant number of college students who would benefit
greatly if you slapped a GPL on it and announced it.  Or is that kind of

  PHWE-E-E-E-ET! Time out! That ain't me. I've run WordPerfect/8-linux, BRU,
VMware, XessSE and one or two other proprietary, closed source products and
do so willingly and without any complaints. No one's heard me complain about
paying for software I need. Indeed, I've defended closed source, proprietary
software when that's the best option to solve a problem.

  I've paid for BRU support $100 per yer (now $150 per year) despite not
needing it since I worked out the hardware problems with tape drives. I will
continue to support Applied Information Systems by buying upgrades for
XessSE because it's a fabulous spreadsheet and critical to my business. As a
matter of fact, a few years ago when my fiancee worked for my business for a
few months I bought a second XessSE license so we could both use it. Of
course, I didn't _need_ to do that; it runs on the network and there's no
way the company could tell how many users there are here. But, that's not
the way I operate.

  And this is getting way off the thread. That's why I asked, politely, I
thought, that comments reflect the question I asked and not my ethics.

The problem is the way RedHat upgrades the kernel.  It overrides a lot of
the safeties build into RPM in order to allow people to have multiple
copies of the same package (kernel) installed.  While it usually behaves
intelligently on removal, it could get real ugly if it didn't.

I agree that the "cleanest" way to uninstall is to use RPM.

PS: I just ran a file list on a RedHat 7.3 kernel package, and it looks
like it shouldn't remove anything unpleasant except possibly /dev/shm.

  What? Are text books given away, too? Back when I was on university
faculty my students found benefit from purchasing their text books --
particularly when they came in for an exam. Why aren't all technical books
distributed for free under the GDL? Why should we have to actually BUY a
book on free software? How unfair!

  Sorry, Karl, but I don't take guilt trips. My mother's tried for decades
and I just won't go there. :-)

Free time... There's no such thing. Time is money, money is time. If I'm

You are completely ignoring the fact that I just disproved your 
arguement. Yes, it costs me more to drive, and parking costs more, but I 
DO enjoy driving. The fact that the bus will run anyhow is a 
non-arguement, as we could eliminate all the buses if there were no 
riders. Think of all that tax money that wouldn't need to be collected 
if  the buses didn't run. I don't enjoy riding the max or the bus. It's 
a hassle. The only way to make it not BORING is to immerse yourself in a 
book, so you can ignore the fact that your on it.

If you are browsing with Konqueror, then the setting is in the KDE
control panel, for file associations.  But Mozilla (New Netscape) does
not look there for it's own file associations.  You must configure that
through it's own settings dialog...

I believe that both Netscape 4.7 and Mozilla (Galeon ???) will use the
information in "/etc/mailcap" as well.  On a Debian GNU system, mailcap
is managed by the "mime-support" package's "update-mime" utility.  Many
packages that provide viewers and such call on "update-mime" in their
post install script to add entries.  Below are the entries from my
machine that pertain to OpenOffice.org.  I think you can just paste them
into "/etc/mailcap" (create it if it does not exist) and restart
Mozilla.  I don't know if these all work correctly or not.  If any of
them turn out to be wrong, it's a bug against the Debian openoffice
packages.

Be aware that your email displayer may have word wrapped those long
lines!!!  Each lines begins with a MIME type like:

application/vnd.sun.xml.calc

Red Hat sucks.

The cleanest way, in my expert opinion, is to back up your personal
data, flat the box, and install Debian on it.

They put device nodes in the RPM archive itself?  That's totally BOGUS. 
Device nodes should be created by a call to MAKEDEV from the postinstall
script.  And MAKEDEV should be a no-op when devfs is in use.

You don't say specifically what "it" is in this context, but whatever

It looks like GTK+ is licensed under the GNU LGPL, so as long as you
follow it's requirements, you are probably okay.  I'd suggest you read
the license to make sure you understand its requirements.

BTW, just because the software is a library, doesn't mean that the
LGPL applies.  You aren't allowed to link willy-nilly to GPL code just
because it's a library.  IANAL, but my understanding is that if your
software _depends_ on GPL'd software, then it is effectively
derivative whether it includes any or not.

Remember that the GPL doesn't exist _just_ to keep you from having to
reinvent the wheel.  The pain of reinventing the wheel (and especially
of _knowing_ you are reinventing) is _intended_ as an inducement to do
the Right Thing.

That is not at all the point.  If there is enough to sell, there is
enough to "give back".  It doesn't matter whether it is a general
purpose tool or not.  The point is that the people who eventually use
it be able to fix it or adapt it to their specific needs without
necessarily your involvement.  By selling a closed-source tool, you
not only prevent that, but you also weaken its credibility by
preventing people from evaluating whether your program actually does
what you claim it does.

The kernel packages are special in RedHat land in that you can remove them 
by full name.  Normally rpm won't accept something like

# rpm -e some_package-2.12.14

instead, you would have to do

# rpm some_package

obviously, when you have used rpm to install two kernels and want to get rid 
of one,

#rpm -e kernel

would be unpredicatble and undesirable, so instead you do

# rpm -e kernel-2.4.12-4

(whatever the unwanted version is).


I have accidently upgraded a kernel (-u) instead of installing (-i) and it 
worked.  I did reboot as soon as I could say "crap!" but it worked--no idea 
how...

Actually, it was an attempt to point out that this list was intended to
be for the discussion of Linux/Unix and things related. At least it was
in the beginning, IIRC. Maybe that's changed. If someone were using this
list to promote their cause, say some prolifer or something, you'd be
screaming for their head on a platter. But since it's you, and of course
you are correct and everyone else is wrong and must be set straight,
then it's okay to clutter the list with off-topic threads. WTF?

Rich,
    1. Seems to me that fuzzy stuff has been out there  a long time now and 
there very likely is some open stuff in some stage of development.  For 
example, I once did a baby system in Python.  If you don't worry about or 
postpone the syntactic sugar it's not very hard to do.
   2.  Keep in mind you can often split the problem into _data_ and a control 
system.  The thing you would want to keep proprietary would be the data you 
develop.  Sharing the development of the control system with other users in 
other knowledge domains would benefit you.
  3. If you developed a mixed system, you could allow your clients to access 
it as clients to your server which you would keep and maintain on site.  
Supporting in software is not something you want to do.

Thanks Rich & Steve. What think you of these methods, particularly the
synaptic one?
Dirk

#1;
Let me start with a disclaimer - I've only done this one time and not on
a
RH installation.  That said, make sure that the symlink /usr/src/linux
points to the source files of the kernel you intend to keep.  Then, rm
the
tree of the source(s) you wish to discard.  Also, rm the related files
in
/boot - which is probably the partition that is squawking about
inadequate
space.

#2;
I'm also running Red Hat 8.0 and have upgraded the kernels.  I did
install synaptic and apt-get.  I used synaptic to select the older
kernels to remove, and it passed the remove request to apt-get, which
passed it to rpm.  It edited the grub config file for me too.

Why do you live so far from work?  Would you have moved out there or taken
the job (whichever came second) if you DIDN'T have the option of using a
single-user private automobile for the commute?

That's a matter of perspective, really.  It's 21 minutes.  You can round
up by more than fifty percent and call it "double" and that sounds like
more than "very little", but you can also figure that it takes about 21
minutes to make and eat breakfast or peruse a couple sections of the daily
paper, it really is "very little" time.

Let's drop the whole thing. I started it with what I thought was an innocent
comment, followed by a tongue-in-cheek relating of my own experiences with
strange people on the MAX *and* on busses. It's been kinda fun to watch it
take on a life of its own, but it's time to shoot it, bury it, and plant
flowers on it.

The kernel packages are special in RedHat land in that you can remove
them 
by full name.  Normally rpm won't accept something like

# rpm -e some_package-2.12.14

instead, you would have to do

# rpm some_package

obviously, when you have used rpm to install two kernels and want to get
rid 
of one,

#rpm -e kernel

would be unpredicatble and undesirable, so instead you do

# rpm -e kernel-2.4.12-4

(whatever the unwanted version is).


I have accidently upgraded a kernel (-u) instead of installing (-i) and
it 
worked.  I did reboot as soon as I could say "crap!" but it worked--no
idea 
how...

You can read on the bus or use a cellphone without endangering anyone and
maybe get to know some people that you wouldn't otherwise meet.  If you
drive, your time is spent driving and maybe listening to something.  If
you take the bus, your options are much wider.

And you're building up habits and tolerances that will allow you to live
in a diverse and condensing world without shutting yourself up in little
private steel containers.

I'm not sure how a person can joke about their destructive habits, but I'm
the sort of person that thinks of criticism as an opportunity for
improvement.

First, I think you might have to re-evaluate your definition of "needs" if
you are truly concerned with adopting more sustainable practices in life.

Second, a private motor vehicle that uses less gas does almost nothing
progressive.  Decreasing emissions per trip sounds like a step in the
right direction, but it's a little like a person who is racing toward
Canada at 100mph and trying to get to Mexico by slowing to twenty.  
You're still going in the wrong direction.

You have no idea how expensive your cars are.  First, your roads are
maintained through the wear and tear of hundreds of thousands of private
vehicle trips mostly through the state general fund.  Second, the cost of
your refined petroleum products is reduced drastically by pressures
exerted through the world's largest and most sophisticated terrorist
organization (I'm referring, of course, to the Pentagon system).  Third,
the very cost of your vehicle is subsidized through corporate welfare and
inhumane "trade" agreements.  And last but not least by far, the cost of
cleaning up the waste from your vehicle from production, through its
useful life and maintenance, to its final resting place are covered, once
again, by the public as a whole.  If you were presented with the ACTUAL
cost of exclusive use and operation of a motor vehicle, you'd probably
say, "I can't afford to drive", too.

While admitting that there are bus drivers who don't always make the very
best decisions with regard to their behavior in traffic, I think it's very
important to point out that a bus driver is AT WORK behind the wheel.  
The driver is not rushing to get to work and (hopefully, of course)
concentrating on doing the job at hand with all the dilligence and care
that you or I would take to carry out the duties of our chosen profession.

The driver is not in a rush (the schedules are amply padded and
reasonable) and the route, including lane changes, is predetermined.

I think there are many reasons to believe that a bus driver is far less
likely to stop paying attention on a given trip than a personal vehicle
operator.

Hell, I was walking down the sidewalk a while back and a woman drove out
of a parking lot (on her daily commute, clearly) and nearly ran into me as
I crossed the lot's egress.  I shouted (mostly out of fear -- a fight or
flight response), "Watch it!"
She had her window down and laughed, saying, "I wasn't paying attention."  
She thought it was very amusing that she lost her concentration so
thoroughly.
I replied, in the most snide tone I could muster, "Heh heh!  That's really
funny.  It's not like you could kill someone with that or anything."

A second anecdote.
Whilst riding my bicycle a few weeks ago, a woman changed lanes without
signalling and nearly ran me off the road.  I caught up to her window at
the light and said, "You realize you could kill somebody with that
thing."
She was a middle-aged woman driving an SUV.  She looked pale at my comment
and said, "I sure hope not."
I said, "You're pushing a ton of steel around with that gas pedal.  Even
at low speed, that's more force than you need to squish a human being
flat."
She apologized and said she never thought of it that way.

Last Tuesday, I saw her staring out the window of the 70 bus on the same
route at about the same time of day.

It's a matter of convenience.

If there was a system that would take me from point A to point B DIRECTLY
(or as directly as possible) and cost me just as much out-of-pocket as it
does to drive, I'd take it in a heartbeat. Fact is, there ain't no such
beast. Public transportation is good, and you'll never hear me claim
otherwise, but it's not always convenient. It's a half-hour walk to the
nearest MAX station, and I have no idea where the nearest bus stop is
because I've never seen a bus in our area. I think it's about a mile up the
road.

Sure, cars and busses and trucks and other petroleum-drinking vehicles have
this habit of impacting the nice clean air that we all love and need, as
does maintaining the infrastructure to support the cars and busses and
trucks and other petroleum-drinking vehicles.

Give me a viable and reasonable alternative and I will seriously consider
it.

  This is the basic idea. I _always_ keep the kernel.org Web page open as I
go through the process because I'm not doing it every day.

  I run apt-get but I don't let it "upgrade" the kernel. That's too
important to not have under your direct control at all times.

  The other option, which I did all of one time, is to get the Red Hat
kernel rpms for the new kernel. This is the simplest upgrade path, but you
get what you have because you do not go through menuconfig and set
everything yourself.

  The key to the package upgrade is to _install_ the new kernel, not
_upgrade_ or _freshen_ the existing one. When you run 'rpm -ivh
kernel-*.rpm' you install the new kernel in parallel with the existing one.
Then you copy the boot image into /boot, modify grub/lilo and pick the one
to boot. As with the other methods, when you're comfortable that the new
kernel is working properly you can remove the old one.

  FWIW, my /boot partition is 25M and I've not run out of room as long as I
build a bzImage.

  Not quite. When you install a package you'd type something like:

rpm -ivh opera-6.11-20021129.3-shared-qt.i386.rpm

  But, when you want to remove that package, you'd type:

rpm -e opera-6.11-20021129.3

  You do need to specify the version, but not the entire string.

At the beginning of the talk Fedor said he put the slides on the web and
gave the address.  Unfortunately, I didn't get it and I didn't ask him
to post the URL.  Would someone please do this.

Good talk.

Only if there is more than one version installed, right?  I've only had to 
specify the version when erasing a kernel package.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0212061710020.23580-100000@tpol.peak.org>

My girlfriend has an IBM laptop that used to be dual-boot: she ran
Win98 and I had a small Debian (stable) partition for checking email.
Then she got a Windoze virus that seems to be fixable only by a
complete reinstall, and so she's living in the Debian partition until
we figure out which of her DOS files needs saving.

Unlike me, she needs to print.  And I've never set up printing from
Linux before.  Specifically, she needs to do formatted wordprocessing
and print the results in such a way that they look "professional",
i.e. as if they'd been done in Word.

Any suggestions on 1) what word processor to set her up with; and 2)
what print system to attempt to install?  Does the answer to #2 depend
on the answer to #1?

Thanks,

You can use MS Office files...and when you go back to windoze you can
install it on the windows machine too if she likes it. :-)

otherwise, kword is coming along as well.

openoffice is not kde dependant so you can avoid installing kde if you
haven't already.

I've been using it for a few years now... me likes.

printer... what type of printer do you have?

  I honestly don't know, Kyle. I learned to put the version number in 'way
back when and that's what I've always done. I know that if you put the full
_file_ name in, rpm complains that the file cannot be erased. That's the
difference between the _package_ name and the _file_ name.

  Take a look at LyX. It's not a word processor but a gui front end to the
TeX typesetting system. No word processor produces printed output that looks
"professional"; LyX produces typeset output that _is_ professional. To
print from LyX one uses lpr to print postscript or pdf files. You can also
get html output.
 
  On the other foot, if she needs to import and export winWord docs as well
as turning in printed products then I strongly recommend either
OpenOffice-1.0.1 or AbiWord-1.0.3. The former is easier to use with a wide
range of fonts; the latter is smaller and faster.

  As far as I know, both use lpr to print their postscript output. Several
years ago I replaced lpr with CUPS, but the output string in all three
applications is 'lpr -Plaser5_ps', or whatever printer definition I want to
use.

  Take a look at /etc/printcap (and the man page).

HTH,

Rich

Politics is just another word for the complex set of human relationships.

Mechanics describe how things interact.  Politics describe how people
interact.

Politics are about as useful as mechanics unless you're a hermit.

Ditching car-centric thinking would be a start. Part of the reason it
takes so long to get to your bus stop is because we build huge sprawling
cities to accomodate our cars. Transportation should conform to humanity,
not visa versa. No?

And reading a book is enjoyable to me. The point is not that driving can't
be enjoyable for some. The point is that to call sitting on the bus or
train "wasted time" is silly. Wasted time is in the eye of the beholder.
To me, 50 minutes on a train or bus is 50 minutes I get to read, relax and
watch the scenery roll by as I listen to my headphones. Spending that same
commute behind the wheel for 30 minutes would be a waste of time.

There's more to my life than money. Time relaxing or reading, feeding my
brain, is important.

Besides, I think some of us are talking about efficiency here. If I read
for an hour a day on the bus, that's 1 less hour I need to have at home to
get the reading and relaxing I need squeezed into my day. For my part, I
replace that time with time exercising. Not a bad trade-off in my book.
You just can't see it from my perspective, I guess, but to me riding the
train, reading a book is actually MORE efficient. I'm making better use of
my time.

I would venture to say that most Americans aren't healthy without
exercise. Most of us need exercise. For my part I have a resting heart
rate of 60, blood pressure around 118/75 and cholesterol around 125 to
show for all that wasted time on my bike or relaxing on the train.

That doesn't disprove anything. It just proves some people like driving.
Good for you. Remember that all some of us are trying to do is defend
ourselves from, and debunk, the following accusations...

- The transit system is full of freaks and welfare scoflaws
- Riding public transit is a waste of time

So it's fine that you like driving, but that doesn't *disprove* our
argument that the above IS NOT true.

So maybe we should just get rid of the freaks and welfare addicts who
abuse the bus systems, I guess. Then we wouldn't need those silly busses.

You are arguing something entirely different, which I answered in 
plug-talk. He claimed it didn't take much longer, I proved (by my own 
travel times) that it DOES in fact, take much longer to travel, using 
public transit.

There are freaky people on the train, nearly every day. The drunk that 
sat next to me Wednesday at 8:30 am and pulled two beers from his jacket 
is one example. He was already drunk and smelled of stale beer, at 8:30 
am. And I'm NOT basing my opinion that he was drunk based on the fact 
that he pulled two beers from his pocket. He was stumbling drunk.

I'm NOT, however, speaking of the kids I spoke with on the train today. 
Three young people, one skate boarder, one girl with dreds, and one girl 
with really short hair, got on the train. You should have seen the looks 
people gave them. I joined in their conversation, had a nice chat, and 
got a cheery "Have a nice day!" from them when they got off. I don't 
believe in judging a book by it's cover.

However, that doesn't change the fact that my travel time is WAY up when 
compared to driving. Nearly double. Jeme says 23 minutes (or something 
like that). Well, that's nearly 50% of 53 minutes. When we're talking an 
hour, 23 minutes is close enough to 50%.

I have a pretty good understanding of sharing files between a linux and

internet is how to share files between two linux machines.  Does anyone
have any recomendations on accomplishing this?  I'd like to set

SMB usually works well... if browsing it via smb:// doesn't work (if
you're using slackware and konqueror, Pat just added support in
-current) then you can also mount the shares via smbmount.

Another option, which is less secure, is NFS.

You should be able to find walk-throughs and all sorts of information
about SMB and NFS via google.  It is your friend.  :-)

Well, I don't think you ride the 12 very often..... it is consistently
5-10 minutes behind schedule.  During rush hour, this 5-10 minutes
increases to 15-45 minutes.

I don't know how other routes are - but on the 12, the drivers are
*always* running late, and are *always* rushed.  During heavy traffic
times, the busses are *always* full, too (don't know how I could read,
Karl, while I need both hands to hold on for deer life as this bus
driver tries to make up the time they are behind).

Maybe the route I had to take was just much worse than all the others..
I dunno.  But mass transit, and Tri-Met in particular, is *not* the best
option for a great many people.

To add to your 'they are at work' scenario - a few of the bus drivers
seem to like talking on their phone a lot.  I'm sure you don't think
talking and driving at the same time is good... but a few of 'em do it
regularly.  Personal calls at work... heh.

2 is totaly independent of anything else you choose, and should work for
all printing situations.  There are two options, one is LPR, which I
have NO clue how to do, I belive it's an old Berkley thing.  The one
which I use and would definitly sugest is CUPS, with the GimpPrint
drivers installed if need be.  It has a nice web interface for setting
up printers.  Go to http://www.cups.org for information on installing,
though if I remember on debian it's just an apt-get install cups and
cups-gimpprint (or something like that).

I wrote 21 minutes because you wrote that the public transit commute was
53 minutes and the private vehicle commute was 32 minutes.  I just
subtracted.

And to say that it's "nearly double" is to give a margin of error greater
than 50%.  In order to be double, the difference would be 32 minutes.  
The actual difference is 21 minutes.  You're 11 minutes shy of doubling.  
And 11 is more than 50% of 21.

> Well, that's nearly 50% of 53 minutes.

Actually, 21 minutes is less than 40% of 53 minutes.

> When we're talking an hour, 23 minutes is close enough to 50%.

21 minutes (and even 23!) is much closer to a third of an hour than half.

But we're not even talking about an hour.  That would be to overestimate
by greater than 10%.  And calling 21 minutes 50% of an hour is an error of
more than 40%.

You don't build bridges, I hope.

Perhaps *you* can read on the bus - but I cannot.  Well, I can, but only
if Karl is sitting next to me.  ;-)

I don't spend all day talking on the cell phone, either... it costs
money.

Ahhh.... well... I don't like the freaks, so instead of avoiding them, I
should immerse myself in them?  Interesting strategy.  After I learn to
love the freaks, maybe I'll head over to Iraq and hug Saddam (I'm sure
we could settle all this stuff if everybody just hugged each other).

Well, I haven't felt any destruction from driving either vehicle... and
as long as I'm in my private steel container, do I care if it effects

In all honestly, I do understand where you're coming from, but I'm bent
a little in the anti-tree-hugger direction... stupid environmental laws
have cost me and my family money.  Our stream was classified as a 'fish
bearing stream' - while cows peed in it 150 yards up and it rarely was
more than 3" deep.  But we can't culvert it because we don't want to
hurt the 'fish'.

Fine: meets my wants.  :-)

And no, I'm really not concerned with adopting more
environmental-friendly ways of life.

Not TOO often, but I did take the twelve on Wednesday to a dental
appointment.  (My dentist is right at the intersection where the bus turns
off Pacific Highway and goes down to Tigard Transit Center.)

I was one minute late to the stop and missed the bus (at MLK &
Burnside) but grabbed the 6 as it came up MLK and caught the 12 at SW
Madison as it came through downtown.

The bus wasn't particularly crowded once we got past PSU.  And the return
trip was about the same (only the standing began at PSU instead of ending
there).

Or maybe people just don't know about the express busses for rush hour
folk.

Maybe not.  But driving IS the best option for far fewer.

I've never seen a bus driver on a personal call.  They talk to other
Tri-Met employees about traffic and such, though.

I would say, though, that talking on the phone while driving is a whole
lot less dangerous when the route is predetermined.  Bus drivers rarely
jockey for position.

Anyway, busses aren't the perfect solution, but public transit benefits
people in ways that private vehicles never can.

I used to get motion sickness, but I got over it.  Practice, practice,
practice.

It's caused by a disconnect between the expected motion of vision and the
perceived motion of the inner ear.  Eventually, the two become reconciled.

...and causes brain cancer.  I'm not advocating the smellphone, I'm just
saying that you can do things on the bus or train that you can't do while
driving (unless you're perfectly happy endangering the lives of others or
are arrogant enough to believe that you are infallible and it's worth the
risk to complete strangers).

It's called "Love thy neighbor".  I know it's dangerous.  Hell, I heard
about a guy that got nailed to a tree for telling people about it.

I know the comment about hugging was facetious, but I think that if people
here in this country took a moment to consider the actual plight of arab
people (particularly arab peasants), they would have a completely
different attitude toward U.S. military involvement in the middle east.

But that's a whole different kettle of buttons.

But you HAVE felt the destruction.  You just haven't realized that driving
was part of the cause.  Lower wages, higher working hours, poor schools,
an apathetic public; in essence, the destruction of civil society.  All of
those things are caused by fragmentation and suburbanized society and
largely because of the car-culture (or car anti-culture, as it may be).

That's the kind of joking I meant.  I don't understand how a person can do
that.

Is it possible that some things are more important than money?

It's not entirely an environmental problem, though.  It's a social
problem, too.

I didn't write "more environmental-friendly"; I wrote "more sustainable".  
Environmental protection is just one small facet.

[As an aside, I think that if people cared more about the people in their
world and the importance of caring itself, care for the environment would
be an effortless side-benefit in exactly the same way that destruction of
the environment is an effortless side-effect of isolation and community
destruction.  Nobody would have to go out of their way at all.]

If you're going to drive, drive what you will.  Heck, maybe nobody's going
to face the problem of renewable energy until all the non-renewable stuff
is gone, so perhaps using it all up as quickly as possible is actually
helping.

But I do hope you realize that people (among other things) are going to
have to use this world after you're gone.  The past saved some for you,
now you save some for the future.

The Iriquois had a law that said, "Make every decision based on its impact
on the seventh generation even if it requires skin as thick as the bark of
a pine."  In other words, even if it's really fucking hard, do what
benefits the future before you do what benefits yourself.

It's interesting that terms like "anti-American" only come up in
totalitarian societies.  There was such a thing as "anti-German" in the
1930s and "anti-Soviet" in the middle part of the last century.  But think
about what that means.  What is an "anti-Italian" or an
"anti-Canadian"?  It is absolutely absurd to think that one ideology is
embodied in or exemplified by the concept of "American".

But I do wonder what's "anti-American" about my comment.  It is a
statement of opposition to terrorism which is certainly the stance of the
vast majority of Americans at this time.

The U.S. Code defines terrorism as "any use of violence or threat of the
use of violence to advance political, ideological, or religious agenda".  
I think that fits the purpose and method of the military (and,
interestingly, the police) perfectly well.  I'd be interested to hear a
counter-argument.

Perhaps you can try to read the words and understand their meaning instead
of classifying and applying preconstructed filters to your understanding.

I think this might be related to your problem with "freaks on the bus".

Right.  It's about kooks and pigeon-holing now.  You can ignore the
argument and start joking about stereotypes, but I think the people on
this list are intelligent enough to see through that dim charade.

The public is paying for your car at a far greater cost per mile than
public transit and the general public doesn't even get to use it.

You don't pay the full cost of your car and you just ignore the real cost
because it's inconvenient.

Most Linux Distributions come with Openssh. Some also come with gftp. If you
make sure that sftp-server is in the path sshd was compiled with, this is not
the regular path, you can use these in a very secure way to move files around.
This is the path documented in the sshd_config that came with my distribution;
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin.  The default location for sftp-server in my
distribution was /usr/lib/ssh/sftp-server. I simply copied this file into
/usr/bin and restarted sshd and was able to move files around. I'm not sure if
restarting was necessary.

The older Openssh versions used a separate sftpd and ssh1. The issues with the
older Openssh and with ssh1 not being secure mean that you probably need
upgrade if you're still using it.

If your distribution comes with gftp, I would suggest getting the latest
version as large file support is now available and it definitely uses ssh2.  
This bit me once. I was transferring 4G files and they were truncated at 2.1G.
This was a gftp issue not a file system issue. http://gftp.seul.org/

Thank you

I believe you are right.  I had the same issue arise when I was
establishing my samba connection between RedHat 7.3 and WinXP.  I guess
I was really wondering if there is an inherent file sharing schema or
solution like what Windows has set up.  I'll do some digging on google
and figure it out.  Thanks for the suggestion.

Robbert,

I've been using Samba for the last several months to network between my
Linux and Windows machines, as well as between my Linux and Linux
boxes. It works fine.

I just recently started playing with NFS, which is actually much
simpler and easier to set up. It has some security issues, but if
you're on a trusted network, then it shouldn't be a major problem. The
problem, as I understand it, arises when a user is logged in as root on
one machine, then logs into the other machine where he's not supposed
to have root access. Like I said, I'm kinda new at it, but I found it
very easy to set up and use.

When I get something like NFS working, I take some simple notes so I'll
be able to do it again more easily next time. If you want, I can email
you my notes on setting NFS (about one page). I just don't want to send
it to the list in general, and interfere with all the people debating
politics, mass transit, and fuel economy. :)

Using -U has the same result as using -i except that it overwrites files from 
the old package.  Kernels are installed into /boot with names that specify 
the kernel version and therefore won't overwrite the older kernels.

By the way, Mandrake doesn't "override" any RPM "safeties" when you install 
multiple kernel versions using RPM.  It allows multiple kernel versions to 
coexist without difficulty (but I suspect that Red Hat does too).

If you installed a kernel using RPM, you should remove it using RPM too.  You 
should be able to safely do this using the longer name for the package as 
Kyle suggested.  Otherwise, if you manually remove the kernel, the removed 
kernel package will remain in the RPM database and cause confusion later, 
unless you make sure that you have removed all of the files corresponding to 
the package and manually remove the corresponding entry from the RPM 
database.

You only need to specify enough to uniquely identify the package.  A complete 
file name will never work because the entry in the RPM database is the 
package name (including version number), not the file name.

You guys are making this WAY too complicated.  When you install a new kernel 
package on an RPM-based system (assuming that you're using lilo),

1. Install the corresponding kernel package(s) using the -i flag.  (-U is 
superfluous but generally harmless.)

2. Look at /etc/lilo.conf to make sure that the new kernel has a stanza in the 
file.  If not, add one.  If this is necessary, it is easily done by copying 
one of the old stanzas and making appropriate modifications.  Most recent 
kernel RPM packages will add appropriate stanzas to /etc/lilo.conf for you.

3. Run lilo.  Make sure that the name that you (or the kernel package) gave 
the new kernel appears in the lilo output.  If not or if lilo complains, then 
there is a mistake in /etc/lilo.conf.  Fix any mistakes and rerun lilo.

4. Reboot and select the new kernel in the lilo boot screen to test it.

5. If the system comes up without difficulty, you'll probably want to make the 
new kernel the default kernel (if the RPM package hasn't already done this 
for you).  If so and if necessary, edit the entry in /etc/lilo.conf to make 
the corresponding stanza the default stanza and/or change the symlinks 
/boot/vmlinuz, /boot/System.map, /boot/initrd.img, /boot/config to point to 
the files corresponding to the new kernel.  Then rerun lilo.  If necessary, 
fix any mistakes in lilo.conf and rerun lilo until it runs successfully.

6. If you want to remove the old kernel, use RPM with the -e flag and a long 
enough version of the old kernel package name to distiguish it from any other 
installed kernel package names.

Using grub rather than lilo is even easier since you only have to add an entry 
corresponding to the new kernel to /boot/menu.lst rather than having to run a 
program every time you change the configuration file.

Even if you completely obliterate your kernel package, it isn't the end of the 
world.  You can always boot from a floppy or installation CD and reinstall 
the kernel package using the RPM binary that is on your hard drive via the 
chroot command.  You might notice that this means that it's a good idea to 
have a floppy or CD lying around when doing any serious fooling around with 
your system.

I hope that this dispells at least some of the confusion.

It's www.openoffice.org NOT www.openoffice.com.

Most people won't want to use LyX.  In my experience, you almost have to know 
LaTeX to make good use of LyX.  Of course, my opinion is based on wanting to 
use lots of mathematics and graphics in documents.  Maybe if you're primarily 
using words it isn't so bad.

If your girlfriend doesn't need tables, Abiword writes perfectly fine M$ Word 
files (really RTF files) and is nicely lightweight.  If she needs to read doc 
files created with Word and edit them while preserving their formatting or if 
she needs to use tables, she'd be better off with OpenOffice (which is not so 
lightweight).  Even the latest version of KWord (IM-seemingly-not-so-HO ;-)) 
isn't quite there yet.

  You can do this with samba, but I'm not the one to tell you how. However,
remember that linux is capable of both client-server and peer-to-peer
networking.

  For the latter I use nfs. On the machine with directories or files you
want to share/use/whatever on other hosts, edit /etc/exports to make those
directories available. For example, on one of my machines I have:

[rshepard at caddis ~]$ less /etc/exports 
/usr2   192.168.55.0/24(rw,no_root_squash)
/usr3   192.168.55.0/24(rw,no_root_squash)
/usr4   192.168.55.0/24(rw,no_root_squash)

  On another machine the /etc/fstab file has these entries:

caddis:/usr2            /mnt/usr2       nfs     rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 0 0
caddis:/usr3            /mnt/usr3       nfs     rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 0 0
caddis:/usr4            /mnt/usr4       nfs     rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192 0 0

  Now I can access any directory or file on /mnt/usrX from the local
machine.

  For executables, it works the same way. Here, /home is exported from the
server/workstation so that's the directory used regardless of the host on
which we log in. I don't know how good nautilis is at working across the
network, but I put a copy of sylpheed and mozilla on each host.

HTH,

Rich

  Well, let's consider history. Are you aware that at the beginning of the
last century (that's the year 1900) the biggest urban polluter was the
horse? Yup, the darn things were processing hay and oats at such a high rate
that New York City was pushing 200-400 _tons_ of horse manure into the
Hudson and East Rivers each _day_. Yup. Really good for the environment that
was, and bound to end life on Earth as it was then known.

  And, of course, riding a bicycle -- or walking -- on unpaved, dirt roads
was a real joy, particulary during the rain and snow. Perhaps that's why so
many women died during childbirth: they couldn't get to the hospital on
time.

  Typhoid was killing thousands of people a year because of bacterial
contamination of public water supplies. It was those money-grabbing, greedy
capitalist dogs that produced the chemicals (what a nasty industry!) and
treatment facilities to clean the potable water supply. But, gee whiz! How
dare they make money from it?

  During cold weather people had the gall to heat their houses! How'd they
do this? By cutting down trees and mining coal. They did not know that killing
trees just for heat is anti-social and that mining -- the oldest industry on
earth (after politics, of course) should be banned forever; or, at least,
force off-shore to third-world countries where we cannot see it.

  Next time you're hugging a tree in an "Old Growth" forest, Jeme, take a
look around you. You will see a biological desert: no small mammals, no
large mammals, no birds -- except in the colosed canopy a few hundred feet
above your head. All nutrients are tied up in the living biomass and there's
no cover, browse or food on the forest floor. Sunlight can't penetrate that
far to provide energy and there only litter and duff slowly decomposes on
the ground.

  Please take politics and personal agenda off the main PLUG list. By now we
all know the opinions and beliefs of each other and we don't need to be
constantly reminded of them. It is just not part of being a good citizen in
a crowded societal bus.

Or I stack to buy a new dual redundant PS?
Could somebody please give me a practical advise on this matter.

problems.  At least once since I've read it, I've grabbed it off the
shelf to check a packet exchange timeline diagram, to see which end of
the connection the problem was at.  I was able to fix the broken NFS in
less than 5 minutes, where before I read that book, it would have taken
10 or 15 minutes of trial and error guesswork.

Would you like an account on the PLUG server, so that you can publish
those notes in your public_html directory there?  That would give you an
@pdxlinux.org email address, and a ~ URL on people.pdxlinux.org. 
Eventually, it will also give you an entry in an LDAP also.

You only need to specify enough to uniquely identify the package.  A complete 
file name will never work because the entry in the RPM database is the 
package name (including version number), not the file name.

You guys are making this WAY too complicated.  When you install a new kernel 
package on an RPM-based system (assuming that you're using lilo),

1. Install the corresponding kernel package(s) using the -i flag.  (-U is 
superfluous but generally harmless.)

2. Look at /etc/lilo.conf to make sure that the new kernel has a stanza in the 
file.  If not, add one.  If this is necessary, it is easily done by copying 
one of the old stanzas and making appropriate modifications.  Most recent 
kernel RPM packages will add appropriate stanzas to /etc/lilo.conf for you.

3. Run lilo.  Make sure that the name that you (or the kernel package) gave 
the new kernel appears in the lilo output.  If not or if lilo complains, then 
there is a mistake in /etc/lilo.conf.  Fix any mistakes and rerun lilo.

4. Reboot and select the new kernel in the lilo boot screen to test it.

5. If the system comes up without difficulty, you'll probably want to make the 
new kernel the default kernel (if the RPM package hasn't already done this 
for you).  If so and if necessary, edit the entry in /etc/lilo.conf to make 
the corresponding stanza the default stanza and/or change the symlinks 
/boot/vmlinuz, /boot/System.map, /boot/initrd.img, /boot/config to point to 
the files corresponding to the new kernel.  Then rerun lilo.  If necessary, 
fix any mistakes in lilo.conf and rerun lilo until it runs successfully.

6. If you want to remove the old kernel, use RPM with the -e flag and a long 
enough version of the old kernel package name to distiguish it from any other 
installed kernel package names.

Using grub rather than lilo is even easier since you only have to add an entry 
corresponding to the new kernel to /boot/menu.lst rather than having to run a 
program every time you change the configuration file.

Even if you completely obliterate your kernel package, it isn't the end of the 
world.  You can always boot from a floppy or installation CD and reinstall 
the kernel package using the RPM binary that is on your hard drive via the 
chroot command.  You might notice that this means that it's a good idea to 
have a floppy or CD lying around when doing any serious fooling around with 
your system.

I hope that this dispells at least some of the confusion.

It's www.openoffice.org NOT www.openoffice.com.

Most people won't want to use LyX.  In my experience, you almost have to know 
LaTeX (as I do) to make good use of LyX.

If your girlfriend doesn't need tables, Abiword writes perfectly fine M$ Word 
files (really RTF files) and is nicely lightweight.  If she needs to read doc 
files created with Word and edit them or if she needs to use tables, she'd be 
better off with OpenOffice (which is not so lightweight).

Using -U has the same result as using -i except that it overwrites files from 
the old package.  Kernels are installed into /boot with names that specify 
the kernel version and therefore won't overwrite the older kernels.

By the way, Mandrake doesn't "override" any RPM "safeties" when you install 
multiple kernel versions using RPM.  It allows multiple kernel versions to 
coexist without difficulty (but I suspect that Red Hat does too).

If you installed a kernel using RPM, you should remove it using RPM too.  You 
should be able to safely do this using the longer name for the package as 
Kyle suggested.  Otherwise, if you manually remove the kernel, the removed 
kernel package will remain in the RPM database and cause confusion later, 
unless you make sure that you have removed all of the files corresponding to 
the package and manually remove the corresponding entry from the RPM 
database.

I don't know how Red Hat does it, or how RPM expects the names to work,
but I do know the Debian + dpkg way.

The file name of a deb package relates directly to the package name and
version number.  These are specified by the Debian Policy Manual:

 http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/debian-policy/policy.html/

The package name must be at least two characters long, and start with a
letter.  It must be lower case letters, numbers, plus ".-" only.  In the
.deb file name, the version number is separated from the package name by
an "_" character.  Inside the .deb, it's stored in a separate field of
the "control" file.

So, to find the package name and version, you split on the "_"
character.  When a package name has a version number of some kind in it,
that's a good indication that it's possible to install more than one
version of that software at a time.  The package will be set up so that
it installs in a disjoint set of locations to the other versions.  This
is mostly for kernels, kernel modules, and shared libraries.

The version number part has two fields also, separated by a "-"
character. (Recall that the version number part is to the right of the
"_" and to the left of the ".ARCH.deb" part.)  The first part of a
version number is the upstream version.  The second part is the Debian
build or release number.  Often there is a need to rebuild and
re-release the same upstream release, to correct problems, make
improvements, or build against newer shared libraries.

Inside the .deb, in the "control" file, the source of the meta data read
by the "apt" system, often the "Version:" will contain an epoch number
also.  An epoch is a number prefix separated from the rest of the
version string by a ":".  This is used when the upstream numbering
system has changed in such a way that what is really a newer version
appears to the .deb version sorting code to be an older release.  In
that case, the maintainer will tack on an epoch number to make it sort
as a newer release.  Epoch's are explained in the Debian Policy Manual,
and in the packaging manuals.

I imagine that the policy and packaging manuals for Debian are worth
reading even if you don't use Debian and only create RPM packages.  The
general guidelines likely apply.

Manure, global warming. Manure, cancer and various lung diseases. Geez. I

I'm fairly certain that many of the advances the modern world now takes

If you do use "apt-get" to upgrade or install a kernel, don't blame
"apt" if that fails, since it's not in control of what might go wrong --
that's a function of the particular package being installed or
upgraded.  Apt organizes the list of packages in dependancy order, and
computes the list of "dpkg" or "rpm" commands to run.

Inside each .rpm (?) or .deb are "maintainer scripts" that run at
particular points during the installation.  Also inside there is an
archive containing the actual files to be installed.  The archive
determines where they go, and the scripts determine what setup steps are
done before and after the install, and before and after the removal of a
software package.

It's likely the post install script that is responsible for listing the
new kernel with Grub or Lilo, for instance.  And it's the layout of the
file archive that determines whether or not that package will clash with
files already installed on your computer.  When that clash is expected,
the package's control data must declare that, or the package manager
should halt with an error.  There is not any way it can detect whether a
maintainer script is in error, however, unless that script exits with an
error code.

No, it all started when I asked "where is a good place to park near
PLUG?" and Jeme said "in your driveway" and told me how convenient mass
transit is downtown (but isn't convenient where I live). Geezus, I
can't believe how this thing had dragged on! From that simple question,
there has been easily over 100 posts of people on one side saying "mass
transit is the answer for everyone" and people on the other side saying
"it isn't the answer for me." Does anyone actually think they're going
to change anyone's minds?

Can we just drop it now?! Maybe move on to a subject dealing with
Linux/Unix? I'm tired of wading through all this pointless political
nonsense.

Debian's "dpkg" does not have a separate "upgrade" and "install"
concept.  When you install something for which a version is already
there, it "simply" performs an upgrade.

This is not a function of RPM, but rather a function of how that
software has been packaged.  The archives inside of the two RPM's must
contain disjoint file sets for this to work, and the RPM's names must be
different.  Probably the upsream kernel version and perhaps some build
configuration information are encoded in it's package name.  (eg:
kernel-image-2.4.18-smp-i686)

If that is not the case, that the kernel package's name is different
from that of other kernel packages, then I think it's a broken design. 
If that "longer name" to rpm you tell of means adding the package
version number to the package name, then it's a broken design.  If what
it does is allow a unique prefix to mean a fully written package name,
then "alright", that's ok... the kernel packages must have that upstream
version information encoded in them like I say above.

With "dpkg", if two separate packages contain non disjoint file sets, or
subsets of their file sets are not disjoint, the newer package is
required to "Conflict" with the older one, and may optionally "Replace"
it.  Does RPM have this?

But at least horse shit is biodegradable.  It may have killed fish

No, it's because they had not yet developped the surgical techniques

  I have a question about backups on a network. I've been doing daily
incremental and weekly full backups for years, but it wasn't until this last
distribution upgrade that I realized I was not backing up everything on
every host.

  Only nfs-mounted partitions from remote hosts are backed up on the server
-- the box with the tape drive and BRU. Is the lack of a complete backup of
the other workstation something that needs to be addressed? If so, how does
one go about doing that on the same backup volume/tape?

  FWIW, it's not been a problem at all over the past 5 or so years, but I'm
just wondering how one would do such a backup over the network.

Thanks,

Rich

Our technology is evolving.  We are, as a species, concerned with our
impact on the global ecosystem.  We are, as engineers, responsible for
creating technologies that are cleaner and more eco friendly.  It's up
to US.  What we provide for the masses is what counts.  They have a
limited set of choices when they go to make a purchase.  We must limit
thier choices to clean technologies.

And to those who live in the money "Matrix"...  Money is NOT the
economy.  Monetary cost is a bogus measure when it comes to a choice
between clean air and water and poisoning ourselves and our planet. 
Money is artificial.  It is an invention of convenience.  It too needs
to evolve.

For some reason, XMMS doesn't seem to work for me in RedHat 8.0. I
tried to load an mp3 in, but it won't play, it just sits there. A
friend of mine just installed RedHat 8.0, and he's having the exact

something I have to do to make it work?

... that money is an artifice (cynically, in it's meaning like "ruse")
of human society.  Contrast that with something more concrete, like say,
the food supply.  "We" can print as much money as we need, but cannot
grow more food than the land will produce.  The monetary "value" of
things is not coupled by any scientific laws to the righteousness of the
stuff being bought and sold.

For instance, it is scientific laws that govern how much food the land
can produce, or how high a concentration of pollutants will produce ill
effects on those who must breath the "second hand" car exhaust produced
by the masses of humanity.

Oil companies and auto companies are tied together by monetary economy. 
They sell cars and fuel for them.  If they sell more fuel, they make
more MONEY.  They don't care if "we" use up a lot more fuel in a day
than is stricly necessary, or if the burning of it pollutes our cities. 
They only care about having the MONEY they get from that sale.  Thus,
they do not care to support the development of more efficient vehicles
that use less fuel.  That only happens when fuel is expensive...

If it was driven by a desire to produce higher quality better engineered
products, with better and better efficiencies, etc, rather than by
MONEY, we would have cleaner air and people like me would complain a lot
less about the reek of your haze.

> It's not entirely an environmental problem, though.  It's a social
> problem, too.

That's very true.  There are a lot of anti social polluting consumerists
out there who could care less what happens to the planet after they die
or what happens to people not closely related to themselves.  To them,
it would seem that "community" exists to facilitate the exploitation of
other human beings.

It's that this "environmentalist" talk is a "threat to [their] way of
life".  He sees that as "anti-american" somehow.  It's not anti
American.  It's anti Greed-Capitalist.  Not anti Capitalist or
anti-free-market, but anti Greed-Capitalist.  If your product is good,
then sell it.  If it's not, we have a problem with that.

It's anti american to repress free speech.  The pentagon is not "us". 
It's a closed society that may or may not have an agenda coincident with
that of the "majority" in the USA.  It is even likely that the concensus
agenda there is that of the Greed Capitalist!  Of course, the opposite
may also be true.  It's a function of who is in power.

And to take that target on their backs seriously enough to keep an eye
on who might in reality be an enemy of freedom and liberty.

Why do freedom and clean air seem so intimately related in my rurally
nurtured mentality?

I agree.  It is inconvenient to "change horses in the middle of a
stream".  Remember the song "Landslide" (Fleetwood Mac)?  About how "I
built my life around you"?  Many have built their life around money. 
When she sings of a "reflection in the snow covered hills", it's a dead
friend dug out of an avalanche.  Literally.

Stay alive, and stay free.

 From the conversations I've had with some drivers (while they are busy 
driving), they get docked in their pay if they are late. So when they DO 
get behind, they try like the dickens to get caught up. Otherwise, they 
feel it in their wallet.

This has nothing to do with the kernel or its configuration.
I've modified the subject line appropriately.

I personally don't see why you'd care to back up pre-compiled binaries
that are always available for download or that you already have on
CD.  Restoration time isn't that much greater than re-installation time if
you just accept default options and then restore your settings from
backup.

If you backup /etc and /home and a few bits from /var (and whatever other
little smattering of configuration data you might keep elsewhere), that
should cover you.  A cleverly written tar command line could pack it up
appropriately so that a fresh install can turn into your particular server
with a tape and a single command run from /.

For configuration files, though, you might consider keeping them in a CVS
repository and using Makefiles to control their checkout and placement in
a virgin filesystem.  That way, you could install a new system, check your
config files out of CVS and do "make mail" to rebuild your mail server or
"make rich-desktop" to rebuild your desktop host and so on.  You keep
single copies of the config files that do not vary from host to host.  It
might also be interesting to check in the default configuration files and
simply cut branches in the CVS tree for each host or host type.

I talk to drivers all the time, usually about their work.  I've NEVER
heard that their pay is docked.  I'd be absolutely shocked if this were
true because their union is actually quite strong (by modern American
standards).

Late arrival at the end of the line usually diminishes break-time and THAT
might be an incentive for some drivers to "try like the dickens", but for
most it's relatively minor.

I'll look into this today.

Send me your user name, full name, daytime phone number, and SSH 2
"id_dsa.pub", and I'll create an account for you.

After you log in the first time, do:

% echo '<password>" > ~karlheg/DropBox/<userid>
% chmod go-rw ~karlheg/DropBox/<userid>

... where <password> is your IMAP password, and <userid> is your login
user ID.  I will erase it right after I set your IMAP password.

That password will work with IMAP over SSL on port 993, IMAP with TLS on
port 143, and with Squirrelmail at https://mail.pdxlinux.org/. 
Alternativly, you may use a .forward file, which you must create after
you log in.  You will have <userid>@pdxlinux.org for email then.  (You
won't need the Yahoo anymore, unless you want to separate "business"
(plug) from personal mail.)  Please be sure to check the mail
regularly.  There are no quotas, but please be neiborly.

You can use scp or gFTP and SSH2 to copy your web stuff over to your
~/public_html, or you may run XEmacs on drizzle.pdxlinux.org once you
log in.

Be aware that it's a Celeron 400 something, and not super fast.

Actually, I was referring to the social problems caused by car culture IN
ADDITION to pollution (which is really a side-effect).

And the comment about exploitation is pretty close to dead on, based on
the actions of some.

"This Golden Age of communication
Means everyone talks at the same time
And our liberty just means the freedom to exploit
Any weakness that we can find."

> Greed-Capitalist Schizophrenia ?

To say that capitalists are greedy is a truism.  As one philosopher put
it, "Asking a capitalist to be less greedy is exactly the same as asking a
totalitarian system to be less brutal.  The question isn't "how do we make 
private power less greedy and brutal?"  But "how do we get rid of it?""

Well, capitalists are anti-free-market.  Enlightenment ideals like those
professed by Adam Smith and Thomas Jefferson are simply non-existent in
today's rhetoric (let alone practice).

All of the economic super-powers of today got that way by practicing
EXTREME protectionism and forcing free markets on those with less economic
and political power.  This is the model that separates the first and third
world.

There are certainly very intelligent and capable environmentalists who are
also capitalists (William McDonough comes to mind, if you're not familiar
with his work, see <URL: http://www.mcdonough.com/ >).  But they are
merely intermediaries or stop-gaps who will hopefully provide some respite
until civil society realizes that private power cannot exist without
massive state support and real change ensues.

> It's anti american to repress free speech.

Power, brother.

I can't imagine how a person can look at something like the Information
Awareness Office at DARPA and fail to see the chilling effect such a
structure will have on free speech.

The news media do not define terrorism.  The UN has been beating its head
against the wall for ages trying to get a definition that everyone
accepts.  However, the objective definition is simply unacceptable to the
United States because it shows that U.S. foreign policy is carried out
through terrorism.

You gotta give props to Karl for that one.  Brilliant.

I highly recommend everyone hear read this page:
<URL: http://www.darpa.mil/iao/ >

Tell me this isn't the most aggressive and straightforward fascist agenda
you've ever read.  (Have you ever read a self-published fascist
agenda?  HINT:  They sound just like that page.)

> Why do freedom and clean air seem so intimately related in my rurally
> nurtured mentality?

Because your concept of freedom includes not just your own personal
freedom but ensuring the freedom of others.  This is the difference
between, for example, Free Software and the merely "open
source".  Ensuring the freedom of others is a broad and limiting concept
and it includes ensuring the same rights and privileges you have are
carried to future generations for all time.  Leaving your progeny with
befouled air and impure water and tained soil is to deprive them of the
simple things that you obviously took for granted.

When GM was found guilty of conpsiring to destroy Chicago's public transit
system, the judge fined them $5000 for the damage done because, in his
opinion, "the damage is done now".

I bought an Amptron K7810XLM machine with 128M of memory and a Duron 950
processor for my daughter. This was prebuilt by Pacific Solutions. I
installed RH 8.0 on it and it has a habit of freezing on her usually
after she goes online using her kppp dialup. Her email won't work and/or
the taskbar is unusable, though she may be able to surf the web unless
she drops a gui into the taskbar and then can't retrieve anything from
there or start a new program as it is frozen.
Does this sound like a memory chip problem?

With RPM, using your words, Karl, a unique prefix is allowed to represent the 
full package name, as it was with commands in VMS.  However, packages names 
have distinct parts, one of which is the version number.

RPM refuses to install packages that conflict with other packages unless 
explicitly instructed to ignore the conflicts.  Newer versions of the same 
package will replace the old package if installed with the "-U" flag or a 
package that conflicts with a completely different package can be forcibly 
installed using the "--force" directive.  Have I answered your question or 
just danced around it?

What are you trying to do that your "wintendo" box can't see? I've got Samba
installed here and it's working pretty good - with the exception of WINS,
but that's a whole 'nother issue :)

Hi all!

I recently installed SMB on my machine and it appears as though my conf is
not behaving properly. I have pasted it below to see what you all have to
say on the matter. I'm on OSX, and I installed smb according to this
document:

http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/documentation/howto/html/osxsmb.htm
l

I used a combination of that file and what prefs I already had set up in the
Samba Sharing package I got from sourceforge to create the file below.
However, my wintendo still can't work it out. Can anyone tell me what's
wrong with what I have in the .conf file? I'd appreciate it.

I just thought it would be fun to add a semi-humorous story to this insane 
multi-issue tirade.  My advisor from graduate school refuses to get his 
driver's license, partly due to his environmental orientation.  But this just 
means that his wife has to drive him all over the place, which defeats his 
purpose and has the added benefit of really pissing his wife off.  I 
sympathize and mostly agree with his sentiments but the practical 
consequences of his decision are hilarious.

Since the system doesn't crash and the symptoms are so consistent, I
suspect it's a software problem rather than a memory issue.

Of course running memtest86 might be a good idea since that's easier than
tracking down some obscure Gnome/KDE bug and there's always the off chance
it really is a memory problem.

Actually I think it's LPD ( line printer daemon). Another "old Berkeley thing" would be TCP/IP ;)

My printcap points to a remote print spool (more complicated?) and it is still just 2 lines long.

Granted if you don't have a postscript printer you have some extra hoops to jump through, but it's not that tough.

With that much money invested in the hardware get a new case with dual power supplies. Maybe an external scsi enclosure? I would hesitate to try any duct tape and bailing wire solutions when the result could be a bunch of expensive, but very dead hardware.

I would be wary mainly of the power supply. An inferior power supply will 
cause all sorts of mysterious problems, and possibly die young, frying other 
components as it fails. Cheap RAM can be a real headache too; and do they use 
shared system memory for video? I haven't looked at the specs on these, I'd 
take a pretty hard look to make sure I wasn't purchasing a peck of troubles.

If you just want an upgrade and you're already committed to buying RAM and
a hard disk, you're probably better off keeping the case and power supply
from your current system and putting in a new motherboard and CPU.  You
can do quite well for $200.

Talk to Eric Raymond sometime.  It's quite shocking the way some people

More importantly, that the right to life cannot be trumped by the right to
property.  It follows, then, that hungry people taking food or homeless
people taking a building is not theft and so on.

Subject: [PLUG] Switching consoles & video card
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212071806180.12582-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Let me begin by thanking all of you who suggested that the screwy display
on my workstation, "caddis", due to the video card going to the Great Bit
Bucket. I just put in a replacement card (ATI Xpert 2000 32M SDRAM AGP) and
the display is back where it used to be. At least the card died a quick
death and didn't suffer too long. I did, but that's a different story. :-)

  Which brings me to my two questions.

  1) This is a Red Hat 7.3 box running the 2.4.19 kernel and XFree86-4.0.2.
When I rebooted the box, kudzu recognized that the 3D Labs Permedia was
removed and the ATI Xpert 2000 inserted in its place. "Cool!", thought I,
"that's easier than hand-tweaking the files as in days of yore." Except, ...

  When I tried to startx, the server crashed and burned because it could not
find the screen section. Well, I edited /etc/X11/XF86config-4 and replaced
the two references to 3D Labs with references to ATI Xpert. Now it works
just fine. So, why didn't kudzu change /etc/X11/XF86config-4 when it
recognized that the hardware had changed?

  I'm sure there's a rational explanation and I'd like to be clued in to it.

  The editing of the config file is the reason for my second question.

  2)  I was initially logged in as a user and I wanted to switch to another
console to log in as root. This would let me work on one console and test on
another. For as long as I've run linux I could switch to a different console
with alt-Fn. Except today. No way I could open a second console!
"Golleeeey," I said to myself, "sumptin' ain't copasetic here-bouts."

  What might be mis-configured that would prevent me from switching
consoles?

TIA,

Rich

  Excellent thoughts, Carla, and these concerns were buried deep in what
remains of my mind. After all, corners have to be cut off deeply to sell
hardware cheaply. Thanks for bringing this to my consciousness.

There is a rational explanation: kudzu does not handle video card replacements 
correctly. I've run into this several times. It's fine for a new 
installation.

Beats the hell out of me. But at least you know kudzu is defective.

That seems strange.

I've always used ctrl-atl-Fn.  I notice in the sawfish window manager (at 
least) alt-fn changes workspaces.


Side note:
When I went to verify that ctrl-alt-Fn really was the sequence, it switched 
to a text console as promised, but the message,

end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 0

is repeating down the screen.  I toggle back to X and check 
/var/log/messages and see that the kernel is spitting this out--I'm scared.

Looks like it has been doing this since Dec 1.  hdc is my cdrom which is 
empty.  Think I'll reboot to see if this will stop clogging my logs...

Depends where you do this from. Ctrl+alt+fn takes you out of an X session to a 
console. Then you switch between consoles with Alt+fn. alt+f7 to get back to 
X. If you have two separate X sessions going, as two different users, 
Ctrl+alt+f7/f8 to switch back and forth.

/etc/inittab controls the default number of consoles, look for these lines:

# Run gettys in standard runlevels
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1
2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty2
3:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3
4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty4
5:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty5
6:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty6

This is the usual default. If these are missing, or goofed up, it could be 
related. But something has to go way out of its way to change inittab.

  That works when you're running X. When working at a console: plain text,
no X Window System running, I've _always_ had alt-Fn work for me. 
 
  Does on this workstation and it does on my notebook. There must be
something elemental missing on the other workstation. Isn't this strange?

Thanks, Kyle,

  They look fine to me:

# Run gettys in standard runlevels
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1
2:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty2
3:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty3

Found it, installed it, and it runs, but...

I put one .mp3 file in the playlist, click on the ">" button and the
song plays. But, if I stop the song and start it again, I get an error
message that says:

------------------------------------------------
Couldn't open audio


	Please check that

1. You have the correct output plugin selected
2. No other programs is blocking the soundcard
3. Your soundcard is configured properly

------------------------------------------------

However, if I click on the song in the playlist and then click on ">"
again, it starts playing. This is not consistent, however. Sometimes it
will start back up ok after being stopped.

Has anyone had this experience? If so, did you figure out what was going
on?

I think that the "cupsys" printing setup is probably superiour to

work fairly well.

Subject: [PLUG] flickering monitor advice?
Message-ID: <1039334021.3308.29303.camel@obelisk.spek.org>

Hello,
  This isn't a Linux-specific related question, but I hope a few people
here might have some insight or advice.

  I recently moved my home office setup to a different side of the room
as well as removed a few of the power strips I had in my Rube Golberg 
extension cord.  Everything works great except that the image both of my
monitors now flickers and shakes whenever the coffee pot heater kicks on
(I believe anyway, it's hard to tell since it's across the room and it's
pretty quiet).  Neither the coffee pot or computer monitors have changed
power circuits (both are on different breakers), only their relative
orientations and number of power strips inline has changed.

  The coffee pot is a pretty simple affair, no motors, no moving parts
(that are electrically actuated) AFAIK, just a clock to turn it on at
specific times and a thermostatically controlled hot plate.

  I'm guessing it's a power filtering issue as several of the power
strips I had inline before were of the filtering kind, and now they're
gone - but there still is one filtering power strip and two filtering
UPSes that the power has to go through to get to a monitor.  

Does this sound reasonable, or am I wasting my time looking into finding
some kind of serious power filtering device?  

thanks,
--Brent

I like CUPS too although it's odd that you can't set some things via the web 
interface, e.g. the default printer.

Hi all folks,

GRUB
====
My RH8.0 box was upgraded from RH7.3.  After installation completed
up2date was run.

Now the RH8.0 box has 3 kernel running

- old kernel - RH7.3
- new kernel - RH8.0
- update kernel - after running up2date

Kindly advise how to remove the old kernel safely without causing an
impact to RH8.0 box  

I expect to remove them one by one;

First - removing the old kernel - RH7.3
Then - removing new kernel - RH8.0

Thanks in advance.

First, I'd check the voltage at the power strips.  Make sure it is at least 
115.  Also make sure that hot and neutral aren't reversed at either the 
coffee pot or computer wall outlets.

While it's true that the surge suppressors (MOVs) in the strips and UPS will 
wear out, the filter should not.  Is it possible to unplug the coffee pot 
long enough to determine if it is the source of the interferance?

Do you have the monitor and computer plugged into the
same power strip? If not, try that. Sometimes if they
are plugged into different places that have different
paths to ground you can greatly increase the noise
pickup. For instance you may have the computer plugged
into a ups and the monitor not plugged into the same ups.
This can sometimes be a problem.

There is a discussion of this problem here

Yes.. that would be fine.. use the rpm -e command and the kernel you
wish to remove. Grub should not be effected at all (it will know that
you've removed the other kernels) and there is no need to reboot once
you've removed the older kernels.

example

rpm -e kernel-2.4.18-18.7.0

Hello,

	I am trying to debug a program. It segfaults and exits. I'm using the
debug build, but I'm not getting a core file when it segfaults. Is there
an option somewhere that tells the system whether or not to create a
core file on segfault?

Unfortunately I don't have a way of finding out the actual voltage at
the outlet, I'll see about borrowing a meter from one of my more well
tooled friends.  I don't think the voltage is low or that hot and
neutral are reversed as my UPSes check for that and light up idiot
lights - I don't have faith that I have a good ground though, some
outlets have a wire, some don't.

Unplug the coffee pot?!  I'll give that at try today though to make sure
it's the source of the problem (or at least what triggers the problem).

Thanks for your help!

Bill,
  Thanks for the hints about ground loops.  They're not plugged into the
same UPS, I'll move them around so one computer/monitor is on one UPS
where I can.  One of the monitors services 2 and sometimes 3 computers
(via a KVM), all of which I've found out by trial and error cannot all
be plugged into the same UPS.  Do you think plugging the KVM, monitor
and the most-used computer into one UPS will be effective?  Or will the
other computers that are connected through the KVM screw with the
grounding when they're plugged into other UPSes?

Thanks,
Brent

CUPS is pretty nice although I had to remove from my workstation and go 
back to using LPRng instead. The one feature that seems to cause some 
problems is that one of the remote printers I need to use is on a 
remote BSD system running "apsfilter". Every time I send a print job 
via CUPS to the remote printer there's an extra large margin at the top 
of every page and there's always an extra blank page associated with 
every print job.

CUPS worked great with my locally connected inkjet. The one feature that 
I wish CUPS supported was a simple non-filtered forwarding only queue 
like what the old-style BSD "lpd" and LPRng support. Without any local 
filtering my remote print jobs come out great. Again this may be some 
sort of problem with apsfilter I don't know but it only happens if CUPS 
does any sort of local filtering first. My own reasoning is that is 
sort of silly to do any sort of filtering of Postscript data when a 
program generates Postscript data by default and the printer the data 
is going to already handles Postscript data albeit by using 
"apsfilter".

"apsfilter" does smart filtering of the printer data and it figures out 
what filter to apply based upon the print data it receives. The remote 
printer is a PCL-only HP laserjet. I get good printer output whether I 
send Postscript data from Linux boxes or native printer data from 
Windows boxes. I just don't know what sort of mess CUPS is making when 
it filters the Postscript generated printer data locally before 
forwarding it to a remote printer. Whatever Postscript data it sends 
Ghostscript doesn't seem to handle it as well the raw Postscript data 
that all of my KDE programs generate when I print something.

I admit to staying away from any custom CUPS setup and use SuSE's YaST2 
program to configure CUPS which might be some of my problems. SuSE 
allows LPRng or CUPS to be used but they are mutually exclusive so if 
CUPS is chosen LPRng is automatically uninstalled as it CUPS if LPRng 
is chosen. With all of the SuSE's configuration stuff spread out across 
multiple files in /etc/sysconfig I figure I'll have an easier time 
upgrading if I use YaST2 as much as possible. So for now I'm using 
LPRng on my primary workstation and I use CUPS on some standalong boxes 
that have a locally connected printer.

Yes, she doesn't usually get the credit she deserves for her activities.  
She seems fairly outspoken on several projects, but her spouse seems to

Yeah, I know.  It's especially helpful if a run takes a long time.

Okay, I'll at least give you some information related to your original 
question.  What I have to say pertains to C/C++ and I can't vouch for how 
much will apply to other languages.  The behavior of a program when there's a 
segfault depends on the signal handler assigned to the SIGSEGV signal.  If 
the program doesn't define a handler for the signal, then the default handler 
is used.  The default signal handlers are "implementation-dependent", 
according to the references I consulted, and I believe that they are part of 
the C library.

If you absolutely want a core dump on SIGSEGV, it sounds like you'll have to 
implement a handler that exhibits this behavior.  I could be wrong about 
where the default handlers live but what I've written should at least give 
you some idea of what you need to do.  Unless your code takes a long time to 
run or it doesn't exhibit the problem in the debugger (which at least used to 
be a problem sometimes), I still think that just running your code from 
within gdb will be easiest.

In case you're interested, the sources I looked at were

"A Book on C" by Kelly and Pohl
"C A Reference Manual" by Harbison and Steele
"Beginning Linux Programming" by Mathew and Stones

The man pages related to signals might also help you.

Good luck,

Mark

Just curious as to how long MOVs usually last? I've read this too but 
how doesn't one go about finding out if the MOVs in a power strip are 
still in a usable condition? I have some power strips that are 5-6 
years old and the indicator lights that supposedly indicate the surge 
suppression circuits are intact still illuminate when the power is 
supplied to the strip.

Does the program consistantly crash? If so you could just run in gdb and 
then look at the stack trace when the program crashes. Other things to 
consider is what signal is occuring when the program crashes. Not all 
signals have a default action of creating a core file when they are 
raised.

The "signal" man page in section 7 of the manpages shows all of the 
signals and the default action associated with them. You can use the 
following command to see the pages:

man 7 signal

11. I'm almost done with this project.

10. I don't need to know this. I'll never have to debug Fortran code.

9. I don't care if Microsoft offers me a million bucks I'll never work for
them.

8. I'm so glad we're learning cutting-edge technology that I'll be able to
apply as soon as I graduate.

7. When I get out of here I'll be able to influence corporate IT decision
making.

6. The stagnation of the IT industry is merely temporary.

5. With all the tinkering I've done on PCs, these classes are going to be
CAKE!

4. The massive network of friends I've developed on ICQ is really going to
come in handy when I start looking for work.

3. My ray tracer will revolutionize the gaming industry.

2. Working in a cubicle is a healthy and rewarding working environment.

1. I'll go party after I finish this perl script.

Can't say how long, depends on how many spikes you get (how many joules 
they've absorbed).  Read somewhere that 2-3 years is about it.  There is no 
practical way to know that they are still working.  They are sacrificial 
components, poor little guys.

Here in Portland, the service seems pretty decent.  My folks live in 
Connectitcut and seem to lose a few appliances a year due to brown-outs and 
surges.

Safe bet that the MOVs in your outlet strips are shot.  You can replace them

If the flickering CRT is intermittent, a ground loop seems less likely.
If the flickering is constant, then perhaps a ground loop.

What was it that told you not to plug all PCs into the same UPS?  Were you 
tripping a breaker?

The KVM switch will bond all the chassis' together through the shield of the 
cables.  Maybe you have one machine with a hot chassis?

You mentioned that one of the outlets is ungrounded.  It'd be nice to fix 
that: the simple way would be cut power to the outlet, remove it and see if 
there are three wires coming into the box.  If so, replace the outlet with a 
grounded one.  If not, you need to run a ground from the breaker panel.

To keep all this on-topic, chant "linux is as linux does" for the duration 
of your troubleshooting endeavor.

Cheers,

Which could be bad. Replacing some libraries with newer version can 
break some software.

If I WANT multiple kernel packages installed, then I use -i and install 
the second kernel package. It puts kernel, modules and whatnot in kernel 
name specific locations and filenames. Grub or lilo get's updated with 
the additional kernel so I have the choice at boot time.

The same goes for certain libraries. There have been times where I 
needed library.so.2, but my distribution came with library.so.3. Linking 
didn't work, and there was much teeth nashing as I tried to figure out 
how it worked.

Finally, I was able to -i (install) the additional library, alongside 
the existing, newer library, and everything worked.

In some cases, source would have worked as well, but in others, building 
from source complained about the missing library (linked or not) too.

No, -U isn't "superfluous but generally harmless". -U will cause RPM to remove the current kernel and modules. -i causes the kernel to be installed along side the current kernel. Most of the time, this is OK, and everythings works as expected. There is a rare occurence of bad installation, where the new kernel won't load. If you don't have the old kernel on the system anymore, then you get to fix it after using a boot disk.

It is intermittent, I determined that it is in fact caused by the coffee
pot from some more testing today.

I was exceeding the UPS capacity somewhat it seemed - a few months ago
some construction was being done on another apartment and whenever the
cabinet maker's compressor kicked on it would cause all the lights to
turn OFF for a perceptible fraction of a second.  During that time the
UPS could never compensate for the power loss and I'd find myself
looking at reboot screens; moving a few power cords around on my other
USPes solved the problem.

I've seen what I think is this before and noticed a "tingle" when
touching an improperly wired appliance, but none of my computers seem to
have that issue.

I've had it open before when I added an outlet to the opposite side of
the wall it's on and it doesn't contain a grounded wire :(  Adding one
would be considerable effort I'd guess unless it was put on the outside
of the building; the breaker box is 2 floors down through finished
spaces (one of which is quite nice), going through walls with an
amazingly byzantine wiring and gas/hot water heat piping network inside
of them.  I'd like to wire it on the outside of the building, and
actually run a whole new circuit so I wouldn't share that circuit with 3
other apartments, but the breaker panel is completely full.

In my indefensible defense, Red Hat's kernel upgrade instructions always say 
to use "rpm -Uvh" when performing a kernel upgrade.  However, as you have 
rightfully pointed out, Russ, this is bad advice.

Many years ago I converted some regular power strips to ones with surge 
suppression by adding MOVs to them. IIRC there was an article in Byte 
Magazine that had some simple howto instructions for doing this and the 
MOVs were easily obtained at my local Radio Shack store. That was back 
in the days when Byte used to have all sorts of cool do-it-yourself 
projects in it.

Yeow I have a bunch of not-so-cheap APC SurgeArrest units that are 4 
years old now. :(

Can you give an example?

A webcam should simply be generating a bare image available via HTTP with
maybe an HTTP REFRESH header.

If it ain't HTTP, it ain't a webcam.

You can get a core file by using the right "ulimit" invocation.  Check
the shell man page or info.  In Bash, you can type "help ulimit" and get
a brief.

I've found that the most useful way to run GDB is to run it under XEmacs
(I've never gotten it to work under GNU Emacs), so you can have source
level debugging.  I cannot vouch for other distros, but I do know that
if you "apt-get install xemacs21" on Debian, it will Just Work right off
the net.  Basicly, you open your main.c, put the cursor inside main(),
then type "M-x gdb", and follow the prompts.  Once gdb is running, you
can put the cursor back into your code, and use "M-x gdbsrc-mode", then
use the toolbar to set a breakpoint.  Hop over, and run the code, and
you'll have step and trace, follow the arrow and highlight through your
source code.

Well, for other languages that compile to real CPU assembler object
code, the similar is certainly possible -- that is, the program could
attempt to access RAM that is outside of the area allocated to itself,
and then the operating system would trap that attempt and ... Hmmm.  The
question we must answer is whether the program gets sent a SIGSEGV if it
has not registered a handler for it.  I do know for sure that the core
file is produced by kernel code, and not the C library.  Without
resorting to a manual...

Alright, I've got my XEmacs visiting the kernel-source-2.4.18, it's
loaded with "cscope" support, and I've got cscope indexes built. 
(apt-get bought me all of that, and it Just Works) I use the Cscope menu
to select "find symbol", and type "segv".  I find a bunch of references
to a "segv:" label in "signal.c", but none of them are for i386, so I
try again.  Let's try "sys_segv" once. Nothing.  Hmmm...  Next I try
"find egrep pattern", for "segv".  It's grinding away...

Ok, I find "goto give_sigsegv;" in "arch/i386/kernel/signal.c", and hit
enter on the top one to go take a look.  Here's what I find lower down:

give_sigsegv:
	if (sig == SIGSEGV)
		ka->sa.sa_handler = SIG_DFL;
	force_sig(SIGSEGV, current);

So now I put my cursor on "force_sig", and use the "find symbol" again
to track it down.  There's a bunch of hits... let's try again with "find
global definition".  Ok, this time only one hit, in "kernel/signal.c" on
line 693...  I track on into "force_sig_info", same file.  The comment
here says:

/*
 * Force a signal that the process can't ignore: if necessary
 * we unblock the signal and change any SIG_IGN to SIG_DFL.
 */

Now on into "send_sig_info", we find... our way on, through several
functions... and I've lost the trail.  I must find out where the process
actually becomes active, and where it checks for pending signals then
actually calls the handler or does the core dump.  Let's try another
tactic.  "find egrep pattern" for "core"... and scan by eyeball... Ah,
here.  "arch/i386/kernel/signal.c", line 683:

  if (do_coredump(signr, regs))

Alright, and there's a switch checking for signal names!  Let's "find
global definition" for "do_coredump" now.  Ah, and here's the kernel
actually creating a core file!  You'll notice that it's checking
"current->rlim[RLIMIT_CORE].rlim_cur" to see if you're "rlimit" for core
files is set high enough to make a core the size this one will be.

A signal handler is generally code you write yourself.  It's sort of
rude for a library to take over a signal on you, unless that's well
documented.  (libgpm had issues wrt this, IIRC)

There are some interesting SEGV handlers in some of the GNU software. 
The emacsen trap it and save your buffers before they crash, for
instance.  That's a lifesaver when you're using a development version to
develop a development version. :-)  The "Bug Buddy" dialog in Gnome is
done with a SEGV handler also.  I believe (IIRC) that KDE also has a
similar common widget.

I highly recommend the GNU Lib C manual!

The book I learned C from was called "Workout C".  It was a very good
textbook.  It came with a C compiler for DOS.

It occurs to me that part of the reason people print things, like PDF
files, rather than read them on the screen, is to put off actually
reading them.  "I'll print it and read it later", they rationalize, then
never get around to reading it until the last minute, perhaps.

Does anyone have any of the ITU-T X series documents in PDF format? 
They charge for them, and I cannot afford to buy them.  Actually, they
let you download 3 for free, but I need more than three of them.

Perhaps if several of us got together and co-ordinated, we could each
download three, then share the loot.  Anyone want to do that?

Maybe it's just really strong coffee, and you're sped up so much by it

Well, then, are they crunchy enough?

"tramp" is a remote file access deal for the emacsen that uses "scp" to
let you transparently edit remote files.  Once it's installed, you can
use a file name of the form: "/[user at host]/path/to/file", and it will
find that file and let you edit.  When you save, it copies it back
over.  This is very useful, since you don't have to run XEmacs on the
server whos conffile you are tweaking.  It only needs to run an sshd,
and you need key based (password free) access.

"fsh" is a Python program that multiplexes a single SSH connection.  If
you need to issue multiple ssh commands, you can use "fsh" instead of
"ssh".  It calls "ssh" internally, and sets up an 8 bit clean pipe to a
"fshd" on the other end.  Thereafter, your ssh commands are run through
that one pipe.  It's faster, since you don't have to set up and tear
down the connection each time.  It works very well with CVS, as the
"CVS_RSH" program.  In fact, that is what it was designed for.

I could not get "fcp" to work as a replacement for "scp" in "tramp".  I
did not have time to mess with it, and was wondering if anyone else had
figured it out already or not?

How did it not work?  I've never had any problem with "M-x gdb".  I
just scanned my .emacs infrastructure and didn't find anything

That is why I wrote "simply" in quotes like that.  When a library is
upgraded, often a lot of software must be recompiled, depending upon the
kinds of changes made to that library between revisions.  Some changes
are binary compatible, others are not.  For instance, if the size of a
certain struct for which there may be instances in the user's code has
changed, there's a binary incompatibility.  If all changes are internal
to the library, and all of the call signatures are unchanged, then it's
probably binary compatible.  Another thing that can change is file
formats, for example, the Sleepycat Berkeley DB file formats can change
between major revisions.

The upstream library version numbers are meant to convey information
about whether or not they remain binary compatible with previous
releases or not.  You can find out about that with a little web
searching and some reading.  The conventions are fairly universal amoung
all of the logicale libre projects.

Automatically upgrading a system using a cron job can break it also,
especially when you've got something like Oracle installed and it's link
dependancies are unknown to your package manager and upgrade tools. 
They will upgrade the C library, for instance, leaving you with a
non-working database server.  You might not even notice until 6 weeks
later when you actually try to restart that database server.

Or you've one package installed that still uses so.2, and want to
install another that is linked against so.3.  Thus, you need to be able
to install both versions at the same time, in order to facilitate the
transition.  For quite some time, both libc5 and libc6 where in use.  I
have only ONE package left installed that still wants libc5.  Somebody
should fix it...

In this situation, the Debian distribution will provide "libmumbler1"
and "libmumbler2" packages, designed to be installed side by side.  The
1 library for older not-yet-ported code, and the 2 library for the new. 
Inside those packages, you'll find, for example, "libmumbler.so.1.0.1"
in the "libmumbler1", and "libmumbler.so.2.0.5" in the "libmumbler2".

For the same reason, the kernel images have the kernel version and some
brief build configuration information encoded into their package name,
in addition to the package version.  That is why you see the kernel
version twice in a Debian kernel-image package, eg:

 kernel-image-2.6.16-smp-crusoe_2.6.16-1.i386.deb

You cannot install two versions of the SAME package at the same time. 
You can install two packages that are designed to be installed together
that manage two versions of the same software.  This ensures that
everything is DESIGNED to work correctly together, with no file clashes
or hidden surprises.

> In some cases, source would have worked as well, but in others, building 
> from source complained about the missing library (linked or not) too.

Often the -dev packages associated with the 1 and 2 libraries may not be
installed at the same time.  There is usually only one package name for
the -dev parts (.h, auto macros, mumbler-config tool, etc) and you may
choose whether to install the one matching the 1 library or the 2 one. 
For this purpose, each package has a "Build-Depends" declaration, and
apt-get supports a "build-dep" subcommand that will fetch and install
everything needed to build a particular package.  (It is assumed that
you have installed the "build-essential" meta package "manually".)

To prevent "apt" from upgrading you out of a working non-managed
software setup, you can use the Debian "equivs" package to create a
small pseudo package that does nothing more than declare the link
dependancies of that software.  You would write a script that runs "ldd"
for each binary in that software system (Oracle, or Maple, perhaps),
then forms the union of the sets of libraries they require.  You then
make it find out what Debian packages contain those libraries, and put
those in the Depends field of the equiv package's control file.  Once
you install that, the package manager will see the dependancy, and
refuse to upgrade you out of a working system. (if all goes well, ymmv)

I'm pretty sure people print things to paper instead of reading them on a
monitor because staring at a reflective surface causes less eye strain
than staring at a luminous surface.

I can also imagine that many people have poor seating in front of their
monitors and would prefer to recline for long reads.

Not all capitalists are greedy, that is why I made a distinction between
them and Greed-Capitalists.  What I am trying to convey (my nomenclature
re classes of "capitalists" may well be in need of revision) is that
just because you sell a product for profit does not mean you are an evil
greedy daddy war bucks who doesn't care about the welfare of his labor,
or the health of the global ecosystem.  Just becuase the newly
deprecated legacy product you sell presently is no longer viewed as
acceptable does not mean you are behind the times... well, they sell oil
because that's all there is right now.  That can change, but not
overnight.  It's not an easy problem to solve, you know.  There are many
many engineering and logistics problems involved that are way beyond the
comprehension of your average tree hugging pedestrian.

I suppose that not all totalitarian systems need be brutal either. Nor
all facist regimes evil.  Would a benevolent pot smoking dictator or a
totally libertarian free for all anarchy please all of the people? 
There has to be law, order, and coordination of efforts, but there's a
limit to what a government can (not should) practically regulate.  We
don't place all power in a king or dictator because we know that some
men are not responsible given power.  Even our president is bound by
law.

I don't read fascism into that page, Jeme.  Wanting to find ways to
protect your homeland and children is not fascist any more than being a
strict parent is, perhaps.  I have nothing to hide, and am not really

Ok, so there was a greed capitalist attempting to create a more
lucrative market for harmful product.  The least they could do is
develop zero emissions vehicles FIRST.  Then hire a bunch of drivers so
we can still read on the way to work or school.

I don't know, just that it didn't work the day I tried it.  I've
switched back to XEmacs now.  It was probably due to lisp shadows or
something oddball about the particular setup and phase of the moon.

Capitalists are those who exploit the labor of others for profit.  They
believe that the value of an item is the greatest price at which a buyer
can be found.  That's greedy.

I would argue that the value of an item is the lowest price at which you
would be able to part with it.  That's not greedy.

Mercantilism isn't the same as capitalism.  Trade is not necessarily
capitalism.

If a worker or collection of workers buy materials with their own funds,
manipulates those materials into other goods, sells those goods at market,
then redistributes the proceeds to those whose labor produced the goods
and brought them to market, that's not capitalism and there was no profit
(just as you do not say that your paycheck is "profit", but wages).  
Profits are the proceeds remaining AFTER the costs of production INCLUDING
LABOR have been paid.  The man holding profits is the man holding money
that was not the result of labor.  Profits are the result of withholding
funds from those who worked for them.

A capitalist is greedy because a capitalist wants profits (i.e. to take
what others have worked for).

I think everyone reading this is intelligent enough to know that there are
all kind of practical concerns that prevent us from dropping fossil fuels
tomorrow.

A totalitarian regime takes power from people and wields it against them.  
There is nothing more brutal.

Fascism is evil (regardless of ideology) because it strips people of their
individual freedom.

I had this discussion with a dear friend just Saturday night (after
watching Revolution OS at the Clinton, actually, but I don't think those
two things are related).  I think I've come to believe that evil is the
result of inequity of power in all cases.  Evil is everything that the
powerful do to the powerless (short of returning their power).  Good is
anything that promotes equitable power relationships.

The interesting conundrum (and the one that has bothered philosophers
since the beginning of human reason, I would imagine) is how to stop evil
actions without being evil.  The only rational answer is to ignore evil
and encourage goodness.  The result will hopefully be a restoration of
acceptable power relationships.

A civil anarchy would please everyone but those who would like to wield
power over others.

I'd disagree that there _has to be_ law.  I think order is a side-effect
of the coordination of efforts that is natural in humanity.

To me, government (as an organization) exists only as the agency of the
people.  It is not the role of government to regulate, but to be
regulated.  It is the responsibility of people to regulate themselves.

For the eleventy-billionth time on this list, I'll go ahead and quote the
principle author of the Constitution of the United States of America in
one of his statements to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia:

  "The purpose of government is to protect the opulent minority from the
majority."

The result of the system this man put in place (which guarantees political
rights, but had to be amended by Jefferson to ensure civil rights and
totally ignores economic rights) is a State whose primary purpose is to
transfer public funds to private power.  This is the exact opposite of the
ideals of the Enlightenment in which the United States was conceived; to
empower every person and remove the inequities that have shackled the
majority since the beginning of civilization.

I'll finish this bit with the words of Thomas Jefferson himself:

"The mass of mankind has not been born with saddles on their backs nor a
favored few booted and spurred, ready to ride them."

"We should oppose a single and splendid government founded on banking
institutions and monied in corporations."

It's sad that the most enlightened of the founders still appears radical
two hundred years later.

You don't need to read fascism into it, it's there on the page staring
back at you.

Again, read something written by self-proclaimed fascists and you'll
recognize the similarities.

The idea behind all of this is that "we" are universally threatened by
amorphous, undefinable demons whose agenda and motives are totally
unspecified.  The entire purpose of this agency is to strike down dissent
within the United States itself.  The enemy is unspecified because the
enemy is whoever they want it to be at the moment.

I'm sure that's exactly what the Germans and Italians told themselves in
the 1930s.  "We are only protecting our homeland."

Whether or not one has something to hide, one must respect those who do.

Remember the words of Martin Niemoeller, a Protestant minister in Nazi
Germany,

"First they came for the Communists, but I was not a Communist, so I said
nothing. Then they came for the Social Democrats, but I was not a Social
Democrat, so I did nothing. Then came the trade unionists, but I was not a
trade unionist. And then they came for the Jews, but I was not a Jew, so I
did little.

Then when they came for me, there was no one left to stand up for me."

You don't owe me anything, brother.

But I would appreciate your hand in protecting me (and my children and my
neighbors) against the dread threat to my civil liberties y'all call
"Homeland Security".

The least the judge SHOULD have done was require GM to restore the system

Subject: [PLUG] moveing application files?
Message-ID: <3DF46311.AC8A04BD@DPAOA.pcez.com>

I am running  freebsd 4.6.2 Release. With a customised kernel though I
am not sure I have done All the optimisation possible to the kernel.
With a sorce built userland. Pluss lots of extra apps. kde2, linux
compatability, apache ,etc.etc Most of the apps. Installed have been
installed as packadges via /stand/sysinstall . First question: Can I
easyly/safeley move applications from current installed tree locations
to a new location  as I have much more space on a second drive .

dev/ad1s1a       150 MB  root freebsd file system tree includidng /usr &
/var
dev/ad0s2a      5753MB  ufs file system for additional freebsd use

Both above file systems are auto mounted by fstab
I installed the ports collection  as a port in the larger file system as
well as cvsup but do have some quirks to always remember as to how
exactly to get a ported application to install since the ports
collection is not in the usual location. That is a pain in the ass but
necessary to preserve scarse space in my main file system.

second question any ideas where I can find GOOD CLEAR CONCISE
information on the web about compiling & installing applications without
messing up already installed ones. Most of the documentation I have come
across
so far is either confusing to me or the steps suggested  don't  give the
results I am expecting.  Isn't there a COOKBOOK style doc somewhere  "do
this_____ then this_____  " walah you now have a new application or a
remade one you can access via a differnet path than the old one if you
prefere to try your new version.

Check out w3cam.cgi.  It is basically a video4linux cgi script that will send 
an image at a specified interval.  (You can set the interval to 0 to get a 
"streaming" jpeg, that only seems to work on Netscape 4.x).

There is also a Java applet called Camboozle that uses w3cam.cgi to also send 
the "streaming" jpeg.

IIRC, ulimit -c 0 can make core files not exist, if you find a line

The problem I'm having with this one is that it appears from the headers

wondering if many of these spammers do this (probably not). However, if 
any do, couldn't we configure our MTAs to reject mail that comes from 
systems claiming to be it's own host name? I mean, how many times does a 
mail server send mail to itself?

If this is possible, where would I do this in postfix?

See the headers I've included below, specifically, the Received: line.

I have my Spamassassin hit threshold at 4.5, it seems to catch just about
everything.  Maybe you should lower your threshold?  That'd probably be
easier than worrying about other headers.

As long as the logical path to them and to any extra files they require
does not change, they should work fine.  Actually, many will work fine
even if the path to the changes.  Some software has paths to files, like
pixmaps or data files, hard coded into them at compile time.  So if you
want to install it somewhere else, you must rebuild unless you create a
symlink making it appear to be at the location it was built for.

Perhaps the Linux Cookbook or the Rute User's Guide and Exposition will
help?  Both are installed on http://www.pdxlinux.org/dc/, search for
"cookbook" and "rute".

Subject: [PLUG] Take 2: Smb.conf (and related joy)
Message-ID: <BA1A1F39.6182%verso@mac.com>

I originally had this set up using a basic little package with a gui that I
picked up from SourceForge. Things worked fine, but for whatever reason, SMB
server would stop and never gave me any indication as to why, or that it was
doing it at all. I decided to go with the grown-up version of smb server to
see if that would fix things. I set up the .conf with the same shares and
permissions as I had set up under the other system, which all worked fine
(if I had the dumb thing running-I still can't figure out what shuts it
down), but now when I start up the wintendo it says it can't connect to me,
connection cannot be restored, etc. I'm trying to make sure that my smb.conf
is ok before I start checking on other things, since I think the only change
I really made was to go with a standard version of smb server. (My machine
is Mac OS X 10.1.5, the wintendo is on Win2k)

Does that make sense or am I just rambling? It was a lot more coherent
before the 3-minute power outage snarfed most of the original reply. (:

And in this ideal anarchy, what is to prevent the unscrupulous from
taking advantage of others?  What will enforce their civility?  There
MUST be law and law enforcement.  It's an inevitable conclusion.  The
question is then what should those laws be and what may they regulate.

To me, anarchy and chaos are somewhat synonomous.

The coordination of effort cannot happen without process of law;
parlimentary procedure in committee to actually perform the planning and
decision making itself.

Well, that is democracy.

Democracy and capitalism are not related.  There is no reason why we
cannot have both democracy and socialism.  Though it would be silly for
the government to run every little small business...

My pet peeve with many Samba configurations is that when files are to be
shared with Unix, the mapping of DOS attributes (the archive and system
bit) should be turned off, and the settings for what the file's
permissions should be ought to be set in some fashion.

There are several projects where it is obvious that someone edits from
Windows over a Samba, since all of the "x" bits are set.  It's annoying.

Spamassassin is sweet though. :-)

It's cut down on about 80-90% of my spam... I'm really impressed.

Thanks, I'll try it. I wasn't too specific about the
problem earlier. Suppose a message says: "Want to
watch my live Web Cam?" When you click on the link, a
dialogue box asks what to do about 

http://members.aol.com/JohnPaulIII/cam.exe

or whatever it might be. If you want to "open" it, it
asks what application to use, and you don't have the
right one. This was in Konqueror, by the way.

I have an XP box at home that I can't get to see shares on my OSX box
(10.2).  I dunno if you did this already but did you turn on SMB in the
Network Preferences, and edit your user and check preference to allow your
user to login from windows?

I'd love to be able to find out how to get this to work...right now if I
want to transfer files between the OSX and XP box, I have to drop the
files on my Linux SMB server (which both XP and OSX can connect to).

already my Spam count has gone way down.  Of course I just stash it in the

I have an XP box at home that I can't get to see shares on my OSX box
(10.2).  I dunno if you did this already but did you turn on SMB in the
Network Preferences, and edit your user and check preference to allow your
user to login from windows?

I'd love to be able to find out how to get this to work...right now if I
want to transfer files between the OSX and XP box, I have to drop the
files on my Linux SMB server (which both XP and OSX can connect to).

So it is in fact not GPLed. But rather some license that you have made up.

Well, I just increased the level assigned to "NIGERIAN_TRANSACTION_1" 
and "NIGERIAN_TRANSACTION_2" from the default of less than 1 to 3.00.

Matt:

My issue is that I had to retrofit my machine with smb. See, Jaguar already
has it installed and part of the OS, and still being back here at .1 means
that my prefs aren't looking the same. I've heard that this is cake in .2,
but it sounds like that's not a sure thing. (:

All the stuff I set up before worked, when the server was on. I wanted to
figure out either a) what's shutting it down, or b) how to make the 'real'
smb setup work. As of now, I have no answer for either one.

I'm not an expert, but it seems as though XP is sort of tricky on this front
(I'm trying to get my parents home network set up via phone and it's not
been easy).

Have you tried making your wintendo rejoin the domain?

In you Network properties, move your machine into a workgroup, reboot,
re-join the domain.

Caveat: You'll most likely have a problem with any profiles you have
created, since Windows joyously sees the server/user combination as a new
domain, causing it to create a new profile for the new user/domain
combination. This is true even if you have the same name on your domain. If
you know how to move profiles, tho', you should be okay. I don't know how :)

I originally had this set up using a basic little package with a gui that I
picked up from SourceForge. Things worked fine, but for whatever reason, SMB
server would stop and never gave me any indication as to why, or that it was
doing it at all. I decided to go with the grown-up version of smb server to
see if that would fix things. I set up the .conf with the same shares and
permissions as I had set up under the other system, which all worked fine
(if I had the dumb thing running-I still can't figure out what shuts it
down), but now when I start up the wintendo it says it can't connect to me,
connection cannot be restored, etc. I'm trying to make sure that my smb.conf
is ok before I start checking on other things, since I think the only change
I really made was to go with a standard version of smb server. (My machine
is Mac OS X 10.1.5, the wintendo is on Win2k)

Does that make sense or am I just rambling? It was a lot more coherent
before the 3-minute power outage snarfed most of the original reply. (:

On my SMB Linux server, the Home share looks like this (and works from XP):

[homes]
  comment = Home Directories
  read only = No
  browseable = No

Pretty simple...maybe you should strip your smb.conf down and try it that
way...

I am doing the same thing. I have my SPAM folder...and I find a bit of
guilty pleasure in seeing the tally get higher and higher. I almost don't
want to delete them because I like to see how high it's getting. When I
get 1000 spam messages I'll delete...and if you are my monitor, or any one
around me for that matter, you will see the biggest grin.ever.
:-D

Let's race...and see who gets to 1000 first!

(...to much time on my hands)

Hello Linux folkz,
Could somebody from the experienced Linux server 
builders help me to solve this dilemma.
I have a task to build Linux DB server with SCSI raid.
I has to be a pure DB server without any fancy graphic
and sound stuff running in run level 3 all the time.
I have tho motherboards on my hands.
Tyan Thunder K7X S2468UGN AMD-760MPX chipset
and Tyan Tiger K7 S2462UNG AMD-760MP chipset.
Which one is the best suited for a such task?
I can't tell the difference in depth between
MP and MPX chipset, but the board with MPX has
two 64bit (3.3v and 5v) at 66 MHz PCI slots, MP has
five 64bit 5v at 33 MHz PCI slots.
Do modern PCI RAID controlles really support 66 MHz
PCI bus or it's just a marketing bluff?
Thank you in advance for any advises.

Alex

Well I've worked around the flickering monitor issue - it did turn out
to be the coffee pot.  I now brew the coffee and pour it into an airpot
that keeps it warm and after turning off the coffee pot no more
flickering occurs.

Thanks for the help!

I'd be interested as well...
colo-co-op?
or just a share..?
I'd be interested either way...

If I could find some people to go in on a colo server with
dns/postfix/apache/mysql... I'd be a happy guy.

If anyone is interested, send me a message.

Subject: [PLUG] Anybody else using OSX with Fink?
Message-ID: <1039462023.3276.37435.camel@obelisk.spek.org>

Hello,
  I've been playing around with a friend's new-ish model iBook (the
square white ones) for the last week or so, installing all the things
needed to run a web application I've written.  It's gone actually quite
smoothly with the aid of Fink (fink.sf.net), but it's really quite
slow.  Quite a bit slower than a PII 233 with 128MB ram that's my "dev
server" here at home (the iBook is a 700 Mhz G3 with 384MB ram).

  To hear most Mac fans talk I should be in possession of a
supercomputer that's been crammed into a cute little white plastic
package but last night when I compiled apache and php it took about 3
hours to complete on the iBook, on my PII the same operation takes about
30 minutes; those times are somewhat guesses as I wasn't timing them.  I
do have timing routines in my web app though and it runs 2-3 times
slower for most operations.  "Normal" OSX applications (Photoshop,
BBEdit, etc) seem to be fairly snappy.

  Has anybody else seen something similar?  Did you have a fix?

thanks,
Brent

You might also ask on the Samba mailing list.
Sign up: http://lists.samba.org/mailman/

I agree with Matt. You should take your samba.conf file to a bare minimum
and build from there. I believe that there have been issues reported with XP
and Samba, but nothing that can't be fixed.

Matt:

My issue is that I had to retrofit my machine with smb. See, Jaguar already
has it installed and part of the OS, and still being back here at .1 means
that my prefs aren't looking the same. I've heard that this is cake in .2,
but it sounds like that's not a sure thing. (:

All the stuff I set up before worked, when the server was on. I wanted to
figure out either a) what's shutting it down, or b) how to make the 'real'
smb setup work. As of now, I have no answer for either one.

I'm not an expert, but it seems as though XP is sort of tricky on this front
(I'm trying to get my parents home network set up via phone and it's not
been easy).

What about what Cooper said would make this non-GPL? He simply asked

Sounds like GPL to me...

As far as controllers go. Most newer 64bit cards support 33,66,100, and even
133mhz. It just depends on specific model and mfgr.

Message-ID: <1039464791.3df4f9572e39d@newcastle.devrandom.net>

Well, thanks to a dead CMOS backup battery, my 570E has been rendered 
unbootable thanks to the supervisor password set by its former owner.  I 
contacted IBM, who informed me that the supervisor password is not removable by 
a client process (no shorting the 'CMOS clear' jumper type solution), but 
required an EZServ repair at a 'authorized' IBM tech shop.

Now, I know the supervisor password is stored in an EEPROM on the motherboard, 
and that there are several services who, for a fee, will desolder a write pin 
to prevent accidental modification and then proceed to use their own 
methodology to read out the lost password from the chip.  My question is: is 
there such a facility/shop here in Portland who offers such a service, or am I 
stuck shipping the Thinkpad off to IBM or one of the alternative services?

Thanks much!

- Geoffrey

Have you tried making your wintendo rejoin the domain?

In you Network properties, move your machine into a workgroup, reboot,
re-join the domain.

Caveat: You'll most likely have a problem with any profiles you have
created, since Windows joyously sees the server/user combination as a new
domain, causing it to create a new profile for the new user/domain
combination. This is true even if you have the same name on your domain. If
you know how to move profiles, tho', you should be okay. I don't know how :)

I originally had this set up using a basic little package with a gui that I
picked up from SourceForge. Things worked fine, but for whatever reason, SMB
server would stop and never gave me any indication as to why, or that it was
doing it at all. I decided to go with the grown-up version of smb server to
see if that would fix things. I set up the .conf with the same shares and
permissions as I had set up under the other system, which all worked fine
(if I had the dumb thing running-I still can't figure out what shuts it
down), but now when I start up the wintendo it says it can't connect to me,
connection cannot be restored, etc. I'm trying to make sure that my smb.conf
is ok before I start checking on other things, since I think the only change
I really made was to go with a standard version of smb server. (My machine
is Mac OS X 10.1.5, the wintendo is on Win2k)

Does that make sense or am I just rambling? It was a lot more coherent
before the 3-minute power outage snarfed most of the original reply. (:

Geoffrey,

  Give Northwest Computer Support in Beaverton a call. They may be able to

I'd suspect most people print out hard copies of documents simply
because reading off of real paper is so much more pleasant than reading
off of a computer display. But that's all conjecture, as is any
discussion without a real study.

That's my rational for loading up my hard drive. I save files to disk
that I'll "read later." You should see the size of my Temp/Reading
directory. :-(

I mentioned that later in my message.  There is no way to stop people from
abusing an imbalance of power without imposing an imbalance of power.  One
can only rely upon the belief that if you feel as though there is an
imbalance of power in a relationship, you can reach out to your neighbors
to help you restore the balance.

"Crimes" of property are easily remedied (and even prevented) in a world
of abundance.  The real threats are grand crimes of overt power exersion
(claiming control of land and property you cannot use personally to create
artificial scarcity) and crimes of passion.  The former is practically the
definitionof "law enforcement".  The latter cannot be prevented by "law
enforcement" anyway.

> There MUST be law and law enforcement.  It's an inevitable conclusion.

I don't see how you're coming to such an absolute certainty about that.

"Law enforcement", historically and consistently, only enforces property
relations (which is what allows some to have very much while others have
very little) and crushes dissent (which is anti-democratic) through
violence, fear, and intimidation.

> To me, anarchy and chaos are somewhat synonomous.

How can someone who has seen the results in Free Software development and
adoption hold this view?

People are, by their nature, orderly.  They are cooperative and kind.  
They only deviate from this norm when they are deprived of some necessity
or mentally ill.  Neither the deprived nor the ill benefit punishment.  
They need care and love and an understanding of and reason to believe in
their inherent equality with other people.

Pretty much anything short of consensus becomes tyrannical.  
Decision-making should always be left in the hands of those most effected
by the decisions.

If a person doesn't agree with a decision, they're not going to abide by
it.  If a person consistently disagrees with the decisions that effect
them, they will become a rebel and work to destroy the decision-making
process.  The goal is to stop rebellion before it happens by pleasing
everyone as much as possible.

In a world without tyranny and inequality, there is no way to impose
decisions on a person who does not agree.

Yes, it is.

When you say "the government" you really mean "the state", right?

There would be government in each and every little small business, but
that just means that it would be governed by the people who are effected
by its operation (and the people would govern themselves individually).  
Far as I can tell, there is no reason for the creation of a State in a
civil society.  The state serves only to consolidate power (perhaps
derived from the people) and wield it against those who dissent.

Interesting that the bits about "Homeland Security" were left out of this
message... but I'm not through reading all my new messages yet.

My first response was to say that Aqua (OS X's GUI) is a pig (which is
true), but then I wouldn't expect that to have any bearing on compiles
times and web script performance. You could always install Linux. It
actually runs quite well on the iBooks, and the performance difference
is stunning.

Could it be something in the OS X developer tools? "Jaguar" (OS X 10.2)
uses gcc 3.2, IIRC. Maybe it's not optimizing things the way it may
under Linux. Dunno. Pure speculation.

Right.  I figured it was something like that.

What you have there is a situation where someone is using a proprietary
application (and quite possibly a proprietary protocol) to deliver a
webcam image because they want to do something other than simply deliver a
webcam image.  It could be spyware or adware or something, but it's not
primarily designed for viewing pictures from a webcam.  There are already
plenty of very useful tools for doing that without proprietary software.

If you want spyware and adware, run Windows.

As for me, I prefer Free Software.

Agreed. Also, paper copies are nice for distribution. Carry and read them 
anywhere, make notes, pass them on. Print select pages from a company's Web 
site to give to friends, it's an easy way to make a referral. 

It's still the most reliable backup method. No worries about obsolete media, 
electric surges, or needing a machine to access the data. I doubt that any 
electronic data storage used today will have much longevity, it becomes 
obsolete too quickly. All of my clients incorporate hard copies of their most 
important data into their backup schemes. Paper's not going away for a long 
time. 

I'd like to see a high-quality automatic-sheet-feed OCR gadget for converting 
large quantities of paper docs to digital files. Then you have the perfect 
world: easy conversion to create the files, easy conversion to restore files.

A $199 PC with No Windows, No Intel Inside Sun Dec 8,10:12 AM ET
By Peter Henderson

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Here's the pitch for what could be your next PC: No 
Microsoft, no Intel -- and almost no markup.

By dropping software from Microsoft Corp.(NasdaqNM:MSFT - news) and avoiding 
"Intel inside," retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc.(NYSE:WMT - news) is offering a 
$199 computer it says is a hot seller on its Web site, attracting novices 
looking for a way onto the Internet as well as high-end users wanting a 
second box.

The promise of a PC replacement -- slimmed down to surf the Web and carry out 
limited tasks -- has long tantalized the tech world but failed to generate 
many sales, especially as prices of name brand computers have slid.

The Wal-Mart machines are full-fledged, if low-powered, computers, but they 
are not loaded with Microsoft's Windows software or the best known microchips 
-- meaning that the average user will not get exactly what he or she is used 
to.

"It is going to be harder to get people to adopt that sort of stuff" since 
most consumers want Windows, concluded Roger Kay, a PC analyst at 
International Data Corp research group.

Although the Wal-Mart machine has a slower microchip than more expensive 
computers, rival machines may not surf the Web much faster, since the speed 
of the Internet connection is usually the bottleneck in online tasks, said 
Rob Enderle, an analyst at competing research group Giga.

"It is awfully hard to beat this for the price point," he said.

As Wal-Mart heads into its first holiday season offering the $199 machines, 
it says sales are already exceeding expectations.

"What we're finding is largely tech enthusiasts buying these items, but we've 
also seen some individuals, as well as businesses and some schools," said 
spokeswoman Cynthia Lin. She declined to quantify sales, although 
knowledgeable sources put them in the thousands of units per month.

BROADBAND MACHINES

The machines, manufactured by Microtel Computer Systems, aim to provide an 
experience similar to Windows by using operating systems based on the free 
Linux (news - web sites) system. They support high-speed Internet (though the 
service itself is not included) and have a CD drive that can read music and 
data disks, but not record them.

They also have relatively small hard disk drives of 10 gigabytes.

There is no modem, floppy disk drive, or monitor, and the VIA Technologies 
Inc. (2388.TW) microchip that is the brains of the machine may not be known 
to users familiar with Intel Corp.(NasdaqNM:INTC - news)'s Intel inside 
marketing campaign and Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NYSE:AMD - 
news).

The same hardware system with Windows and a modem costs $100 more, while 
companies like eMachines Inc.(OTC BB:EEEE.OB - news), which specialize in 
low-end computers, offer $399 machines with Windows, low-end chips from AMD 
or Intel, a bigger hard drive and extra hardware such as a modem or CD-write 
drive.

Gary Elsasser, vice president of technology at eMachines, said that consumers 
wanted to be able to run any software and find computer help easily. Linux 
makes that hard to do.

"When you switch operating systems, millions of programs no longer work. The 
person next door can't help you," he said.

EMachines annually sells about 400,000 computers at $399 each, Elsasser said.

Freedom -- from Microsoft -- is a chief reason that consumers would buy a 
Linux-based machine, said Jason Spisak, marketing director of Lycoris, a 
nine-person start-up and one of two companies supplying Wal-Mart with an 
operating system for the $199 machines. The other, also Linux-based, is 
Lindows.

Spisak says his Desktop/LX software is modeled to look like Windows XP (news 
- web sites). "We've basically taken this as far as you can go without being 
prosecuted," he said.

With new word processing and other office software on the way, and based on 
the open office system successfully developed by Sun Microsystems Inc. for 
Windows, Linux and other operating systems, Lycoris machines are good for 
light word processing, Web surfing and e-mail, which is 90 percent of what 
people use computers for, Spisak said.

"These (computers) are getting closer to an appliance," that will satisfy new 
users and power users wanting a second machine, he argued.

"We're looking at a consumer who has less sophisticated needs," he said.

I probably would if it were mine, but I don't think my friend would
appreciate it much.  I find my Sony z505 running linux is smaller and
snappier than the iBook (though it can't come even remotely close to
matching the iBook's battery life)

It's running 10.1.5 and it uses gcc 2.95.2 - and oddly it's fairly
snappy this afternoon(?!) perhaps it was the coffee pot that I turned
off..

This sounds like a job for Gnomemeeting, AFAIK, there is no KDE
equivelant.

BTW, camserv is another camera to webpage server, it doesn't use cgi, it
is a standalone server.  It works with all newer Netscapes and Mozilla
(I didn't test any other browsers, sorry). There is also a java script
that will give the illusion of working on IE, but it really runs a loop
that captures and displays static images at no faster than one a second
(the smallest time increment that I could get the java script to
understand).  It also has relay capabilities, so you can stream out of a
dial-up, and have a FAT pipe server relay to all the people that want to
see you sitting at your computer.

I agree that it's ironic.  However, the 8 minute clip of REVOLUTION OS
on ifilm is hosted by ifilm at its pleasure.  So we didn't have any
input into the browser or media player formats.

There is a 28 mb MPEG file of "The Free Software Song" music video
available at http://www.revolution-os.com/Download.html

I hope you get to checkout REVOLUTION OS at the Clinton Street Theatre. 
REVOLUTION OS will be playing there through Thursday night.

Sincerely,

J.T.S. Moore
Director, REVOLUTION OS

Gnomemeeting rocks! I knew nothing about video conferencing. Nada. I 
plug in the USB camera, which the Red Hat kernel recognizes instantly, 
fire up gnomemeeting -- et voila! I had no trouble whatsoever 
connecting to the Polycomm unit at work. Red Hat has even patched 
iptables correctly so it handles the mess called H.323.

I had to play a bit with the audio and video tranmission rates, but 
otherwise everything just worked. What a great piece of software.

Message-ID: <3DF585FB.5040301@dimstar.net>

I have postfix running on one machine, it has the mx record for my

I have another machine that handles a subdomain. (bbbs.dimstar.net)

bbbs.dimstar.net resolves to my external IP, however, the firewall 
forwards traffic through to the proper machine, if it's on the proper port.

I want postfix to deliver mail to the internal machine. However, postfix 
insists on resolving bbbs.dimstar.net to the external IP. Since it can't 
get to the external IP, the message get's queued up, and there it sits, 
until it times out.

Anyone know how to configure postfix so I can tell it to send mail for 
bbbs.dimstar.net to an internal ip?

Make sure you have an entry for transport_maps in /etc/postfix/main.cf,
such as:

	transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport


In /etc/postfix/transport, add:

	bbbs.dimstar.net  smtp:[10.0.0.1]

Replace "10.0.0.1" with the IP address of the box the mail should be 
forwarded to, of course. By putting the IP address in brackets [], 
postfix will ignore the MX records for bbbs.dimstar.net and just forward
the mail to the smtp port at 10.0.0.1.

OK. I'll take the bait. I put this discussion back on-list. Partly
because I was confused as to why it was off-list in the first place.
Yes, I got the same private message from Patrick, and replies from
both Sandy and the other person.

It got into the wrong folder in my email system in the first place,
because I rely on certain strings to be present in the headers for
procmail to sort my messages. As one who gets about 200 such items
aday, I like to have them sorted. When the [PLUG] key is missing from
the subject line, or it comes from a source other than pdxlinux, then
the whole discussion ends up in some other place (not my inbox).

So, why did I post back to the list? Because I'm interested in both
sides to these issues, and posting to a limited set of individuals
limits the fullness of the response. It doesn't teach if you don't
get the whole story -- what's good AND what's bad. I subscribe to this
list in order to learn. I'm out of state, and there is _no_ linux
group where I'm at (no groups at all). ooops - on a tangent again.

Perhaps I shouldn't put off-list dialogues back on-list, but had I not,
this issue would have ended with me not having the better understanding
that I now have. And others wouldn't have the benefit of this bit of
knowledge.

Okay, here's the deal: I've got a copy of a program called Arson. Some
of you may know it. It has a lot of cool features that I am very
interested in, such as burning audio discs from a variety of different
formats: mp3, ogg, shn, flac, wav, etc. Anyway, it only works correctly
when running as root. I have the source code and want to figure out why
I can't run it as a normal user. Funny thing about it is that in an ssh
session run from Windows at work, I can run the program just fine as a
regular user. Weird, eh? I just want the program to dump a core file so
I can more easily use gdb to figure out the problem. Using gdb without a
core file isn't very helpful to me as I'm really not a programmer. I can
code some Perl when I have to and understand c/c++, but not enough to
figure out where this thing is crashing. I've tried ulimit -c unlimited,
ulimit -c 999999 (this I put in my .bashrc file and it reflects properly
with ulimit -a), but nothing I do seems to create a core file. It simply
crashes with a segmentation fault and I'm just not talented enough to
figure out why. I don't necessarily want an answer to why this is
crashing, I would like to figure it out. If I just had a core file, I
could understand what gdb was telling me, I hope. I'm using RH8 (sorry
all you Debian folks, but I just can't get that distro to run on this
machine without weeks and weeks of figuring out how to get network
cards, cdrw drives, etc. to work. I use it on my laptop and that won't
even dump core files with ulimit -c unlimited either). Any ideas would
be helpful.

Bruce,

I am quite certain your actions were well intended. However, sharing private
email in a public forum without first seeking and gaining permission of the
parties involved is a breach of privacy. Given that the discussion centered
around use of GnuPG, there's a bit of irony there. Patrick was understandly
annoyed.

BTW...

Paul, which USB camera.  I'm getting to the point of buying one but tired 
of getting the mostly working item and having to figure out what needs 
tweaking.  A Plug-n-Play would be nice verses a Plug-n-Pray.

This tweaking I don't mind!

Promise you won't laugh. :-)

It's some cheapo USB camera my mother-in-law got when she signed up 
with EarthLink. She had no use for it, so she handed it to me. I 
promptly put it into a box and forgot about it for a year or so. Then 
my boss asked my to evaluate gnomemeeting...

If you're really interested, however, lsusb says that it reports 
itself as a 'Xirlink, Inc. (IBM) C-It WebCam':

  idVendor           0x0545 Xirlink, Inc.
  idProduct          0x8080 (IBM) C-It WebCam
  bcdDevice            3.0a

I've never tried another camera, so I really have no clue how it 
stacks up against non-gimme hardware. :-)

What I do know is that Greg K-H and the rest of the Linux USB coders 
have done a nice job.

  Wouldn't it be nice to see how the pundits have calculated TCO? I wonder
how the concluded that a server running "normal back-office" applications
costs more on linux while one running a Web server costs less. Guess I need
to re-read "How To Lie With Statistics", eh?

Answers are only as reliable as the questions that produce them.

In my grad school days at the University of California, Irvine, the 
core of the first-year graduate History curriculum was a full-year 
series of courses call History and Theory.

The first quarter dealt with ecomonic theory (Smith, Marx) and the 
impact its questions (freedom of markets, class struggle, etc.) have 
had on historians and their writings. The second quarter dealt with 
social theories (Weber, Foucault, ...), the third with psychological 
theories (Freud, Jung, ...).

The meta-conclusion of the course was facinating. An economic
conservative and a Marxian produce different accounts not because one
is lying or inferior but because they ask a completely different set
of questions. Ask a Marxian to tell you about Napoleon. Then ask a
Freudian. :-) The art lies in understandining which questions will
produce a better history.

Consultants know this intimately. The real drama in any research is 
framing the questions. After that, it's all boring old engineering.

One trick I've used in the past with relative success, is to use a 
symbolic link. In other words, figure out what directory tree on your 
primary drive takes up the most space (or needs the most space), and 
relocate the whole tree replacing it with a symbolic link to the new 
location.

All,

When discussing the K12LTSP project yesterday and it's benefits, I was
asked about the server side security.

Specifically, is there a mechanism in place to prevent an attacker from
putting a ``fake'' server on the subnet that the clients look for?

In other words, let's say that a thin client sends a Bootp broadcast on
the network. What's to stop a hacker from plugging in a false server and
intercepting client requests?

Of course the attacker would have had to have compromised a `real'
server to gain login information, etc. to make this work and it would
likely be discovered very quickly, but still...

I'd be wary of using the CPU in those things and expecting much of an
improvement over your 333MHz P2.

Those C3's are *very very very* slow - their FPU makes the FPU on a K6-2
look fast.

This hampers multimedia, compiling, SETI at Home, and really just anything
you use on the computer.  I wouldn't be surprised if somebody told me
those 387 add-on FPUs for 386's had more power than a C3's FPU.

Nope.  If someone gets access to the local subnet either by plugging in
(bad physical security) or by hacking in, they can run a DHCP server which
will respond to requests from standard DHCP clients.  Whoever gets the
packet to the client first wins (usually).

There is work ongoing to develop an IPSec-based DHCP server which means
that the server itself would need to be compromised.  Each DHCP client
would need to support this new protocol, so it will be some time before
it's really available for use.

For example:

http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-droms-dhcp-relay-agent-ipsec-00.txt
(October 2002)

Your best bet right now would be to put an intrusion detection system on
the network to discover such silliness before it can create major
problems.  (http://www.snort.org)

  Which was exactly my point, Paul. In the book, "How to Lie With
Statistics" (there's now another one called "How to Lie With Maps") the
thesis is that one doesn't have to lie but only select the scale or range
that gives the answer you want.

> Consultants know this intimately. The real drama in any research is 
> framing the questions. After that, it's all boring old engineering.

  In addition to asking the question that will lead to a usable answer is
the task of collecting data and analyzing it properly. By "properly" I mean
objectively and without a priori knowledge of the answer.

  When calculating the Total Cost of Ownership, apparently, one can in- and
exclude factors until one comes up with the desired answer. But, the real
question, IMO, is not the TCO but what solution is the best for the
individual business; best regardless of time span. That does not have a
single, all-encompassing answer but one that varies by company. I strongly
suspect that linux would be the answer in almost all cases, but I'm neither
an economist nor an engineer. Ergo, I don't know what I'm writing about. :-)

  Do you know that if you lay down all the economists in the world, end to
end, you'll never reach a conclusion?

  Thank you, Rob. Along with Carla's warnings about power supplies and other

I'm trying to format a sparse file to contain a filesystem. Just following

# dd if=/dev/zero of=rootfs count=1 bs=1k seek=$[2*1024*1024]
1+0 records in
1+0 records out

# ls -lhas
total 12k
 12K -rw-r--r--    1 root     root         2.0G Dec 10 12:35 rootfs

So far so good. Next step is 

# /sbin/mke2fs -v rootfs
mke2fs 1.27 (8-Mar-2002)
rootfs is not a block special device.
Proceed anyway? (y,n) y
rootfs is mounted; will not make a filesystem here!

umount rootfs says it isn't mounted.

Now what? I've tried just about everything in man:mkfs.

I think that you need to run losetup to "activate" the file as a
loopback block device (/dev/loop0) before you can create the file
system.  Once the file system is created, then you can mount the
"active" loopback device like any other block device.  Note that
loopback support must be available in your kernel, either as a module,
or compiled in.

Actually, the device that rootfs is on is mounted, good thing it didn't
make a file system in this case.

Isn't this true of all network types?  If you compromise the security of
the network, why does it matter what client type you use.  If you
already have access to the server, you could easily get password and
user info.  Maybe I do not understand the question here, but in my
opinion, this shouldn't be considered a liability of the K12LTSP
project.  Correct me if I'm wrong please.

Brian,

It is an issue primarily because of the way the communication between
between the server and the client is carried out.

Are there easier ways to gain access to internal account information?
Certainly. I can think of two ways just writing this sentence that make
the internal subnet easy prey (hint: think ``wireless audit for
prevention).

This case is a little different than your normal communication. Again,
please see above: it would be really difficult in practice to fake a
server for long in practice. Having said that, though it an be done
(think: last night's backup tape).

Here, the client is not asking for _a_ server, it's asking for _any_
server (X Windows client/server nomenclature not withstanding). 

It's just one of those things we need to think about when we evaluate a
new system, ``is this an acceptable risk?''

Again, I totally agree with you here. I mean, if an attacker can manage
to sneak a machine on the internal subnet to sniff packets, for example,
then the Administrator had better brush up on his/her SSL, etc. skills
real fast.

Better yet he should have done that before hand.

Anybody playing/using Ruby?

Here's my situation. On one 'puter I built Ruby and a program called irb 
works fine.

On other 'puter, I installed rpms and irb.rb is there but doesn't run.  Says 
IRB is not initialized. At this point I don't know what that is. Anyone know?

Having previously worked for a company (now defunct) that dealt
exclusively with thin client technology and the LTSP, I understand why
you ask this question.  I was just pointing out, as you said below, that
security is security and not allowing access should be more of a concern
than what could happen if access was obtained.  Who cares what is inside
a safe, if you can't open it.  I do agree that thin clients are more at
risk once inside the network.  Thanks for your reply and explanation
Cooper.

I agree with Brian...
You're referring to the potential insecurity of DHCP, and not the K12LTSP
project in particular.  Most companies run DHCP servers for their internal
clients and they could be susceptible to the same type of network
foulplay, regardless of the chosen operating system.  It would be
considerably easier to be a fake DHCP server for a non-LTSP client,
however, because the LTSP server does so much more than just DHCP in order
for clients to actually work.  In a Windows network, for example, I could
plug in a DHCP server that has everything configured the same as the real
DHCP server, except I set your gateway to go through me instead and then
forward the traffic onto the real gateway while I watch everything going
by.

I use LTSP for about 35 users at my company.  The clients lack hard disks,
floppy drives, and CD drives.  These users plug into a switch which then
plugs directly into the LTSP server.  Each port is connected to the switch
only if there's a client computer plugged in at their desk (there are no
empty cubes with live data jacks).  It would be possible, although rather
unlikely, for someone to unplug their current desktop, plug in a fully
configured LTSP server which uses the real LTSP server as a gateway and
answers DHCP requests.  It still would have to answer DHCP requests faster
than the real server and it wouldn't have the user's correct password for
them to login anyway (unless you were clever and configured things so any
entered password would be accepted).

I just thought of something else I could do...
I could setup VLANs on the switch that only allow each client port to talk
to the port with the LTSP server.  Then it wouldn't matter if someone
plugged in another server.

Matt,

What you prescribed below is an *outstanding* idea! This way, access
control is greatly increased as one would now need to gain access to the
server room to fake a server. Great idea!!

Hmmm....  What version of Ruby does the rpm install? ( ruby -v will tell
you).  Where'd you get the rpm?

Generally, I prefer to build Ruby from source (actually, I prefer to
build most things from source anymore).  I'd recommend going to:
http://www.ruby-lang.org and downloading the 1.6.7 source and compiling it
(./configure, make, make install).  I suspect that something is wrong with
the rpm you got.

Fedor,

I noticed that your screen kept blanking on you during your PLUG talk
the other night.  In order to make that stop, you much snick over to a
Linux console, and use the "setterm" command to shut off the kernel
screen blanker.  "setterm" by itself will print it's usage information.

You might also need to shut off the X Window System's screen blanker,
which you can do using the "xset" command.  It also will print it's
usage when you type it by itself with no arguments.

I've been in the same boat.  What is killer is if we went out and 
picked some 'Really Neat (Expensive)' USB WebCAM it would give us the fits  
:-(

I think I've seen these.  Well anyway I'll check out the gnomemeeting

Message-ID: <1039572417.1624.18.camel@desktop.linuxaid.org>

In the constant struggle to get a shared contact list using Outlook on
the desktop and use something Open Sourced on the server end I came up
with an idea.  I wonder if there is a way to configure Outlook to read
an LDAP server for it Contacts by default.   

I am in the process of trying different options and doing the google
search, but not having much luck.  Has anyone else tried this?  I think
it just might be an easy registry hack, but then again maybe not.  What
do you think?

Thanks,

I just did that and irb works fine now. I'm becoming a convert to building,

I am having trouble setting the default browser to use when clicking a

get Galeon opening up, instead of my preferred Mozilla.  How do I
reconfigure it?  I have already associated mozilla with .htm and .html

Any suggestions?

Look in gnome-control-center -> document handlers -> default applications. I 
think that's the sequence, anyway find Default Applications and look for 
"Gnome Default Web Browser" or some such. It's not configured from Evolution.

Okay.  I was able to bring up the control center, but not able to make
chagnes.  When I su - to root, I cannot get anything to show up in the
right panel, and when I run the tool as myself, I cannot save the
changes I make.

Not to worry.  For most things it's:
./configure
make
make test (optional)
make install (as root)

Not much to it really.  The messages flying by are usually messages from
the C/C++ compiler - unless there's an error reported you won't have to
worry about them.  When errors are reported, it is often nice to know a
little about make and C/C++.

And it really doesn't take long to build Ruby - there's only about 1MB of
source code.

Anyway, good to hear that the irb problem went away.  If you're interested
we've got a local Ruby user's group we call PDX.rb and we meet every month
(had our December meeting last night).  You can subscribe to our mailing
list by sending an email to: pdxruby-subscribe at kohalabs.com

Settings like that are things that are user-specific... running the
program as root would change the settings for root.

Could it be the settings are automatically saved?  In GAIM, for
instance, there's no SAVE button because the options are saved as soon
as you select them.

That's what I thought, but the only highlighted button is cancel.  Apply
and Save are grayed out.

SWMBO -- ``She Who Must Be Obeyed." In short, despite the fact I
sincerely believe we don't have the money, & my other wishes &
objections, I will be spending two weeks in Ohio around Christmas &
New Years'.

Which leads me to the following question: can anyone recommend an
ISP that I could use for a couple weeks, maybe national-based but
having POPs in NE Ohio (specifically Canton), that does NOT require
you to use their own software to connect, & is ethical?

I'm mentioning ``ethical" because one of the ISPs I have looked at
appears to be a spamhaus. It would be a plus if they are Linux-friendly
not because I'll be using Linux, but because I'd rather support
companies with this attitude.

Can I receive some useful recommendations that won't deteriorate into
tedious arguments over politics, software preferences, or meta-commentary
concerning off-topic responses?

Well, depending on Geoff's situation, AOL may be perfect for him.

AOL has a free 45-day trial offer with 1025 hours available for use in
those 45 days.  After they're up, he can just cancel the service.

For initial setup, he'd need Windoze - be it in VMWare, Win4Lin, or
whatnot... although AOL 5.0 works fairly well in Wine.

But from there on out, he could connect via PengAOL... a non-official
client that lets you connect to AOL as if it were a standard ISP.  He
also wouldn't be supporting a company with a bad attitude - instead he
would be taking advantage of their free trial offer and disposing of
them.  Ethical?  Probably not... but this is AOL we're talking about.

You're assured access numbers virtually anywhere you go and it is free. 
It just might be worth considering.

  Thin client/fat hype. Vmware and win4lin have been doing this for several
years now. I suppose that a third competitor might bring prices down and
that would be a Good Thing (TM).

The difference is that the Codeweavers product runs natively on Linux
through a modified wine. No Windows OS license is needed as it is in
VMWare. This is very important when trying to sell to upper management
in an enterprise. With VMWare, there is no cost advantage since you must
own Windows as well. I've been using the standalone version for a while
and its nice.

I don't have any specific recommendations but I thought it might be worthwhile 
to point out a resource that might help you.  You might try looking at the 
ISPworld Search Page at

http://www.boardwatch.com/ASP/Search/ISPSearchPage.asp

These are the folks who used to put out a printed nationwide list of ISPs at 
least once a year (maybe more often).  I haven't looked carefully at it in 
quite a while but it used to be helpful.

If you've already got a Windows Terminal Server with licenses, or if 
you're running a server version of Windows with rdp enabled, you can 
do far worse than rdesktop:

  http://www.rdesktop.org/

It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a full-fledged ICA 
client, but it sure is speedy. I've got an rpm .spec file online 
should anyone want to build it:

Doug,

  Aha! I'll have to see how much it costs for the Codeweaver's product. On
the subject of wine, I also need to see if I can run an old DOS app over it
since dosemu is balking at no longer having pc-dos/7 available.

Thanks for the enlightenment,

Rich

Yes, but it flunks the first requirement: I don't need to install
any software to use the ISP.

The wife's laptop is running Win 98, & we have no O/S CD for it.
The problem of AOL software overwriting various dll files is too
well known for me to consider this route -- although I've used AOL
in the past, & could get it to do what I need it to.

I don't mind paying a few dollars for access, say $10-- to $20--.
And with the right kind of ISP, I'd be the perfect customer: just
connect, spend an hour or two online a day mostly either surfing or
connecting via telnet/ssh to my account at agora, no stupid support
calls or unreasonable demands.

And if they have demonstrated ethical behavior in regards to spam &
user privacy, then I know I won't have to worry about evils like
unreliable connections, server crashes, etc.

Any other suggstions?

Geoff

The possibilities with this are huge. This means replacing Windows desktops 
with nice sturdy lower-cost Linux boxes, and users still get their fave 
Windows apps. At first glance, the cost savings are significant. CrossOver 
Office Server costs $1195, plus $400- $595 per client, depending on quantity. 
It's not cheap, but it's a lot cheaper than the usual multitude of MS 
licenses. Windows licensing schemes are so complex the time and aggravation 
of calculating them should figured into TCO.

I've heard of running a terminal server off Crossover Office (not the server 
edition). Many interesting possibilities.

I have been using VMWare for a while now. I am most happy with it because it 
*works* for my level of proficiency and my desired level of user involvement 
with managing a computer versus 'using' it to do 'other things.'

This talk of WINE encouraged me give it a try. So I went to the site

(http://www.codeweavers.com/technology/wine/)

and downloaded the 6.1MB file (48min - I live in dial-up land. This is 
relevant because of the Wal-Mart/$199 computer thread. Most Wally-Worlds are 
located in, and service rural communities. DSL? A joke. Who can afford it at

I selected the '/fake windows' install. The dialog box congratulated me and 
dutifully went away when I pressed 'Finish.' Things are REALLY looking up!

properly notify you of Wine execution status or problems.

This launcher script relies heavily on finding this tool, and without it, it

a double-click install.

Cooper,
	I tried looking at it, but it loads really slow over a modem. It seems that 
every page is made up of  images. Why would you make pictures of words? I 
only got to a few pages (because it loads so slow), Is there a good reason to 
make it all images? It would load real fast (and be a lot less stress on the 
webserver) if you made it using just text (you can keep the nice background 
image.. If you use the same image for each background you only download it 
once. 
	If you make a low bandwidth version, Ill check it out, but otherwise It could 
take me hours to read it all...

Hmm.  Sounds like you've been on the wrong end of that equation far too
often, or you have a narrow view of capitalist.

Without introducing emotion-laden words like "exploit", let's call it:

    Capitalists produce products and services using labor and raw goods,
    motivated by the profit made as the difference between what they buy
    the labor and raw goods and what they can sell it for in a fair
    market.

The difference between the leaders in a capitalist and socialist
society is that a capitalist is motivated by money (which buys power),
and a socialist is motivated by power.

Other than that, there's really no difference.  Both lead to corruption.

There's nothing inherently wrong with motivation, or power, or money,
or buying and selling on an open market.  And I find it hard to not
laugh when the people who most claim that "capitalists are evil" are
the same ones that argue for collective bargaining and unions, which
is just a different form of corruption, manipulating the supply/demand
curve on the labor side rather than the finished goods/services
side. :)

I'm for full disclosure and a free market, in case it's not obvious.
I'll trade my two chickens for your pig.  Please keep the government
out of that.

If you use "gnome-moz-remote" rather than "mozilla" or "galeon" in the
gnome control center settings, you can edit ~/.gnome/gnome-moz-remote
and change which browser it uses.  (RTFM "gnome-moz-remote")  The
advantage of this is that rather than changing the setting in several
places in gnomecc, you can change it in one place.  Here's what I have

I think that in real life, it's very unlikely that anyone would actually
go through the trouble of setting up a fake server like that.  If you
have security needs to where that's a real possiblity, then I think that
site physical security should be your number one priority.  Check
everyone at the door, use chassis intrusion detection on all
workstations and servers, lock the server room door, and know who's in
the office next door (wiretapping).

If you're that paranoid, what are you doing with those computers
anyway?  Who are you afraid of?

Unless they can control the switch, and can fake the MAC address of the
server, if you ran "arpwatch" on the server, you could get a warning
when a new computer got plugged in on that network.

  http://packages.debian.org/testing/admin/arpwatch.html

I'm not certain, but I think that "arpwatch" will probably also go off
(show an IP change) in case of arp spoofing used to subvert an ethernet
switch to perform snooping on a non-broadcasting switched ethernet. 
That would be a clue that someone is up to something.

Tools like "ntop", "snort", and perhaps "rmon" may also be of value
here, if you set up monitoring and watched for certain types of
anonmalous events.

A way they could fake that out is to use the NIC from one of the
workstations.  That would be difficult if the attacker's fake server is
a laptop, which is the most likely case, I'd think.  It's less difficult
to sneak a laptop in than a server box, for example.

Anybody that could do this would be a VERY sophisticated attacker. 
Wouldn't it be somewhat obvious if there really was somebody doing that
in your office or school lab?

If your terminal server DHCP daemon is supposed to be the only one
running, you should make it authorative.  Perhaps then you would monitor
the network for any stray DHCP response packets, though that will not be
easy given switched ethernet.

What is "vlan", and how does it help improve security here?

data acquisition and control hardware for use with Linux.  10 years
ago we did a longterm (4 years) year-round environmental monitoring
project in New Hampshire using standalone datalogger hardware (CR10[1]
and 21X[2]) from a company named Campbell Scientific (Utah) to control
instruments and do low-frequency A-to-D stuff from weather and similar
instruments (e.g. 0-5V inputs, pulse counting, excitation 0-5V outputs
for measuring resistance, countinuous analog output 0-5V, etc).  If we
were to do something similar today, I think I'd prefer to use Linux
boxes that I could log into remotely and do other interesting things,
like weather cams, etc, satellite internet, etc.  The equipment would
be housed in weather tight enclosures, so they probably don't need to
be as rugged as the Campbell stuff.  What I am looking for is
something that interfaces to standard PC hardware through either a PCI
slot, Firewire, or USB and that can be controlled through some API
from Linux userland.

Any thoughts?

I'd be interested in finding out this info as well.  I'd like to be able
to plug various kinds of sensors (pH, temp, salinity) into a USB bus and
monitor them remotely over the web.  And it needs to be fairly cheap.
(it's a product idea I'm thinking of).

  Most of the field equipment I've used can be set to ASCII output over a
serial interface. Most manufacturers provide a Microsoft-GUI interface to
their software, but it's not always essential.

  I've captured GPS and depth sounder data on my notebook and I know that I
could download water temperature logger data if I needed to. About weather
instruments I know nothing.

  A lot of lab instruments work on the GPIB; at least they used to. I
believe that there are linux solutions to that interface.

  The manufacturers are the best source of information on the output and
control options they make available.

The "wind sentry" instrumentation we used 10 years ago generated
pulses for the anemometer and used some kind of variable resistor for
wind direction.  I am looking for hardware to terminate those wires
to.

Indeed.  I am looking for pointer to manufactures and models so I can
look.  Thanks.

My company, Vernier Software & Technology (http://www.vernier.com)
makes the sort of thing you're looking for, I think. We make an
interface that plugs into a computer, then you can plug all sorts of
sensors to measure things like acceleration, radiation, temperature,
light, CO2, oxygen, you name it. Only problem is, we normally only sell
to schools and educators, as our equipment is *not* industry grade and
can't be used to manufacturing, life support, etc.

Our main software packages work only with Macs or Windows, but in the
last few months we've been working with Linux-based programs. It isn't
a true port to Linux (possibly in the future if Linux becomes a big
enough market share in the classroom <crossing fingers>), but rather
some small applications written with LabVIEW. You can download the
LabVIEW run-time engine, then download our Linux Labview applications
free.

This is all new to my company, basically just putting our toes in the
Linux water, but we're hopeful. The Linux stuff is on this page:

http://www.vernier.com/linux

I hope this helps.

I didn't see what I was looking for there.  They seem to be selling
whole measurement systems, transducers and all, I just want the
measurement and control I/O device that I can attach my computer and
my own transducers to and read and control from Linux.

Subject: [PLUG] XHTML hypertext RFC Index generator
Message-ID: <1039692973.17083.59.camel@bittersweet.intra.hegbloom.net>

I wanted a hypertext index for the RFC's installed on www.pdxlinux.org,
but none was available, so I made one:

  http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/RFC/rfc-index.xhtml

You'll find that you can hop around in it, following "obsoletes" /
"obsoleted by" chains, and that the RFC number and title are a hyperlink
that will get you the text version of the RFC.  You can drag the title
to your bookmarks in Galeon and Mozilla (probably others as well) and
get a nicely named bookmark to the RFC.  Note that since this is such a
large document, you'll probably want to use Ctrl-Click to open the RFC
in another tab, to avoid the time it takes to re-render the index itself
should you need it again.

(Geoff?  Will you please link to that?  TIA.)

The source to the index generator itself is at:

  http://people.pdxlinux.org/~karlheg/doc-rfc.tar.gz

That's a live CVS checkout pointed at my anoncvs server.  Once you untar
it, you can cd into it and run "cvs login".  The password is the empty
string (just press enter).  I think it's done, but if I do any more to
it, you'll be able to freshen if you like.

You may also use:

  http://cvs.hegbloom.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/doc-rfc/

... if all you want is a quick peek at this amazing demonstration of my
awesome Perl coding skills.

It's written in Perl, and uses HTML::Mason to generate the XHTML. (I'm
using Debian 'libhtml-mason-perl' version 1:1.15-1 in Perl 5.8.0.)
Perhaps folks will find it interesting, since it parses the text version
of the RFC index, then fills out a Mason template with the data.  It is
also an example of xhtml and the use of CSS.

I submitted a wishlist bug report on the Debian RFC packages, so perhaps
it will soon be a standard part of that package.

  Ah, sorry, Russell. I misunderstood. They sell weather monitoring

You might want to check out stuff using Dallas Semiconductor's "1-Wire"
interface. I've not done anything with it myself yet, but there have
been hobbiest-type remote monitored weather stations put together using
it.

Try Google'ing on "1-wire" "weather station", and regardless of what you
end up using, I'd like to hear about it and I'm sure the rest of us
would be as well.

I still have vague ideas for using something like MRTG plus some remote
air and soil thermometers and rain guages for my gardening geek needs.

The most popular option right now in instrumentation is actually
ethernet based.  You run a bench-top lan and use socket interfaces
to talk to the part (I think).  It was driven from a couple of angles:

1) Ethernet cables are dirt cheap.
2) There are many, many off the shelf ethernet transceivers available
   to plug into the instruments.

As to GPIB, it is the de facto standard.  Here at work we use National
Instruments GPIB cards, and they have a 1/2 open-sourced driver with a
very well documented API.  There was a completely open-sourced driver
for it that was being built in a university in Germany.  For many years
it was abandoned, but I think I remember reading that it has started to
be developed again.

When I was teaching Physics at PCC, we used a similar set of tools from
Pasco, http://www.pasco.com.  These are not industrial grade either, but
very fun to play with (at least I thought so, I'm not sure my students
did).  They support M$ and Mac (can't tell what version though).

Subject: [PLUG] shorewall dnat?
Message-ID: <3398.208.151.243.124.1039718922.squirrel@mail.robbyrussell.com>

I am making an attempt to use DNAT in shorewall to connect to an internal
pc... that is running vnc server on it on 9900...

I added this to /etc/shorewall/rules

DNAT    net     loc:192.168.1.251 tcp 9900 -
DNAT    net     loc:192.168.1.251 udp 9900 -

however, shorewall is dropping it from even getting that far.

I've looked at the shorewall documentation and don't think that I am
missing anything...at least nothing that seems to be standing out

here is some of the output from syslog

kernel: Shorewall:net2all:DROP:IN=eth0 OUT=
MAC=00:60:97:d3:f9:d9:00:02:fc:84:d8:8c:08:00 SRC=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx DST=[IP

SPT=3355 DPT=15400 WINDOW=64240 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0

any tips examples for me to use in trying to figure this out would be
greatly appreciated...

I was in a meeting with upper management that are really upset about spam.  I am trying to
come up with some ideas on how to stop it or at least reduce it ( i am getting over 40
spam messages a day).  We have a redhat linux pop 3 email server and lots of windows
nt pc.
Is there something that can I can by to  put on the linux box?  If there is will it require
some on full time to maintain it?
Is there a third party company that could monitor the email before it get to use?

Also has anyone heard of Sopho anti-virus?  I am looking for someone that knows
how to configure it.  It seams to be working, just have some configuration question???

Thanks

We're setting up a (netmeeting) video conferencing, apparently we're
encountering some problems making connections to the remote workstations.
It seems that RH poxy server is restricting it.  is there a config file
somewhere, or something i need to change to open up ports?

Abraham,

  What are you using for your MTA? If you install postfix on your linux box,
and that's the mail server for the company, it can readily be configured to
filter out most spam. Heck, even I got it set up in place of the default
sendmail, and I've been tuning it since last May. I now get between 0-6 spam
per day that slip past all the filters. I'll send you a copy of yesterday's
mail report (generated by pflogsumm.pl and mailed to me each day).

  No. Since we're strictly linux here I pay no attention to the AV stuff.
However, you can also set up postfix to reject mail with any executable
extension.

I'm right there with you.
Although It might be best to simply get everything you might need/want
integrated onto the mb.
That way case/packaging becomes less of an issue and drivers should all come
from 1 source. 
Example. You need to rack mount in 1u chassis. Gettin all on board is a
must. But if you just want to stick it in a mini tower or need a large array
of drives your requirements might differ. 

In short stability and support are paramount to my way of thinking.

<opinion>
If you're looking for true server-class motherboards, I'm not so sure that
either MSI or ASUS are the way to go. I am in no way impugning their quality
as motherboards for desktop machines, but for servers there are other
issues.

The onboard IDE RAID is great - for home use. For an enterprise-class server
it should be SCSI. IDE can't really do hot swaps very well - tends to go
into fits.

I've used IDE RAID at home and for some non-mission-critical servers, and
even on the Linux server, with the Promise controller. Works great. But you
have to be aware of the limitations.
</opinion>

Of course, I could be wrong. Totally.

This isn't relevant to my original question, but I happened to I ask
them once about their protocol for the serial cable connectable
receiver model[1], and was told it was proprietary.  It is possible it
is easy to reverse-engineer, but their loser attitude turned me off.
They wanted to make you use their lousy windows software.  No thanks.

Subject: [PLUG] lilo.conf global options
Message-ID: <3.0.6.32.20021212152405.009f48e0@mail.inetarena.com>

Much of what I've read about lilo.conf indicates the global option line 

boot=boot-device (often boot=/dev/hda) 

specifies an entire disk.  With boot=/dev/hda Lilo will install itself on
the MBR, which gave me problems during a dual-boot install.

I need Lilo to install itself on /dev/hda2, which will be my Linux boot
partition.  In the lilo.conf global options is it valid to specify a boot
"partition", e.g. boot=/dev/hda2, rather than an entire disk?

I know GRUB is available for multiple-boot systems, but I want to learn
more about Lilo before moving on.

TIA.

Well I meant that as far as I know making netmeeting work
behind a linux machine doing masquerading is a very difficult
thing to set up at all, especially securely. 
I once set this up on a machine running a 2.2 kernel and it 
sort of worked for initiating outgoing calls, but I never made it 
work for incoming calls and after I upgraded the kernel it broke 
and I never wanted to go throught the pain to make it work.  One of the main
reasons this is hard is because Netmeeting uses
dynamic port assignment
http://www.gnomemeeting.org/index.php?rub=3&pos=0#AEN214

But the current literature shows that there are those who have 
persisted and made this work
http://www.meetingbywire.com/Firewalls.htm
http://www.freesoft.org/software/NetMeeting/

Has anyone else had a better experience with this?

Bill

The answer to your question is "Yes."  See Section 2 of the LILO mini-HOWTO

http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/LILO-2.html

for details.  You might also find the Linux + NT Loader mini-HOWTO

http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Linux+NT-Loader.html

to be useful, despite its advanced age.

I should have mentioned that I have used the method described in this

efficacy on XP, however.

Message-ID: <20021213001348.51360.qmail@web14409.mail.yahoo.com>

Start reading the howtos on H323 applications. If you are trying to
funnel multiple workstations through a single nat or proxy, it's not
going to be fun, if it will work at all. A workaround: Give your
machines behind the proxy static nat entries, each one with a unique
Internet IP address, and it can probably be made to work, but it's
not very secure because of the large number of ports you have to open
for the dynamic port assignments they use. Does anybody else know of
an easier/better/more secure way to get multiple client
videoconferencing to work correctly? Here at my work we are using
some of the latest video bridge equipment with special Cisco PIX
proxy code for the h323 traffic, and it works, but not reliably. The
main problem, as I understand it, is that in some cases when the
clients start to negotiate a connection, the internal IP (e.g.
10.0.0.55) of the NATted machine is passed out to the external
machine along with a semi-random port number to call back on. The
external machine then tries to establish a connection back to the
private address it received, on the random port, and, of course, it
all goes nowhere really really fast. The Cisco stuff gets around it
by using a 'fix-up' protocol on the firewall to sniff the outgoing
packets in real time, and then rewrite them with a good Internet IP
and fixed port. It sort of works, not quite there 100 percent yet, at
least with the mix of multi vendor equipment we use.

Subject: [PLUG] tree to html
Message-ID: <3DF9454D.7000900@pacifier.com>

...or unix tinker toys

Trying to write a bash script (perl solutions will not be suffered)
that will htmlize a directory listing in a nice tree-like way.

First approach used `find` and if the filename wasn't a directory,
I echoed a few &nbsp's to indent it.  But when your directory has more than 
two levels, that approach falls appart and you are looking at keeping track 
of how deeply you are nested so you can output the proper indentation. 
Gnarly stack ops in bash dude.  Some other day.

So, Plan B:
Htmlize the output from `tree`.

$ tree TESTNEST/
TESTNEST/
|-- Dir-Three
|-- Dir_One
|   |-- five way.txt
|   |-- one.txt
|   `-- two.jpg
|-- Dir_Two
|   |-- four.bin
|   `-- three.html
|-- application-info
|   `-- user.applications
`-- dir-four

Unfortunately, when you supress the cute ascii graphics |-` the output 
looses its indentation, like so

$ tree -i TESTNEST/
TESTNEST/
Dir-Three
Dir_One
five way.txt
one.txt
two.jpg
Dir_Two
four.bin
three.html
application-info
user.applications
dir-four

not much of a tree.  So then I tried using `tr` to delete the cute ascii 
graphics, but of course that also corrupts filenames.


QUESTION:  Is there a better tool to A) Provide a tree-like output, and 2) 
substitute strings instead of single chars.

If I could substitute "|--" with "&nbsp", I'd be a little happier.

Well, perl is THE unix tinker toy, but if you don't want to do things the
easy way...

It seems like you could just use `find .` and check to see if the current
output string is a substring of the following output string and if so
store it as $CURRENT_DIR and indent appropriately moving down the
tree.  You could use sed to split on the / and see what comes out that
way, too.

It all seems rather complex when perl and tree do it fairly nicely.

> So, Plan B:

Did you try `tree -H`?  Was that just not what you needed?

You could modify the source so that -H puts out something more like what
you wanted.  I'm not a master C programmer and I took a look and saw that
I could do it without too much effort at all.

> QUESTION:  Is there a better tool to A) Provide a tree-like output, and

I think modifying tree to give what you want is probably the easiest
route.

It's called sed, sir.

Subject: [PLUG] Machine won't boot
Message-ID: <3DF95604.9CF07F52@attbi.com>

Not a linux problem, but since it's happening before any operating
system loads, maybe someone will have an idea. When I turn the machine
on, the memory test runs, and the boot steps begin. I get the message
about trying to boot from the CD, and then trying to boot from a floppy.
However, instead of continuing on and booting from the hard disk, the
process begins again, as if I had hit the reset button. How I got to
this point is as follows:

In my continuing experimentation, I decided to reload one of my machines
with the factory rescue CD, add an additional hard drive and load RH 8.0
on it. I started with about 4 Gb with Win98SE, and 8 Gb with RH 8.0 on
the first drive. I put the factory CD in, and it started with formatting
the 4 Gb partition before loading the Windows image. I wanted to go back
to the full factory condition, so I bailed from that load, started up
with the Windows start diskette I made the last time I ran the install,
and tried to use fdisk to eliminate all the old partitions and create
one new one. This didn't work. DOS fdisk would not work correctly on the
linux partitions. It could see them, but would not erase them. By this
time, GRUB had been hosed, so I booted with the linux rescue diskette I
made when I first installed RH 8.0. I used its fdisk to write an empty
partition table. Then I went back to DOS fdisk, and successfully created
a single partition (that's the way the machine came originally). I ran
format /s, put the rescue CD back in, rebooted and it did it's thing,
writing all the files to the hard drive.

Any ideas about what step I skipped, or what I might have done to the
machine would be appreciated.

Well I know, from experience, that ASUS is certainly lacking
when it comes to built-in diagnostics.  IBM has them.  Can't
speak for MSI.

IMHO, there's nothing that sucks more than a (server) mother-
board which can't even run a check on it's own memory and
report a failing module.  (Had a bad DIMM a few months ago
which probably cost more in labor/time/frustration to trouble-
shoot than buying IBM/HP/Dell/etc. would've cost in the first
place.)

When one suspects hardware problems, it's really nice to press
[F1/Delete/Tab/....] and go into BIOS diag routines to test the
system -- or at least have a bootable CD with diag tests which
actually matches the hardware in the system.

Take a look at Tyan Thunder K7X Pro S2469 or Thunder K7X S2469 mobos.

http://www.tyan.com/products/html/athlon.html

These boards have everything what is nessesary to build a decent 
mid range server. SCSI, VGA, dual LAN controllers, plus new 66 MHz PCI bus
and other goodies. If you want to build a real server better go with SCSI.
IDE RAID is just a crap in the long run.

       -H baseHREF
              Turn  on  HTML  output,  including HTTP references.
              Useful for ftp sites.  baseHREF gives the base  ftp
              location when using HTML output. That is, the local
              directory may be `/local/ftp/pub', but it  must  be
              referenced       as       `ftp://hostname.organiza-
              tion.domain/pub' (baseHREF should  be  `ftp://host-
              name.organization.domain/').  Hint:  don't use col-
              orization and/or ANSI lines with this  option,  and
              don't give more than one directory in the directory
              list.

I'm using tree v1.3.  I have the source tarball and could probably rustle
up the URL from which I retrieved it.

I'm not really thinking about myself.  I've been fairly lucky to often be
employed by people who aren't making a profit and, thus, paying me more
than my labor's value.

But the bulk of people ARE on the wrong end of that "equation".

Well, "exploit" is the word used with regard to copyrighted work in the
TRIPS treaty and often used in economics texts to describe the extraction
of profits by withholding from the public.

I agree with everything but the chosen verb.  Capitalists don't
"produce" anything at all.  They simply come by to collect the proceeds
and dole them out as miserly as possible so that as much is left in their
pocket at the end as possible.  Assuming no subsidies on the raw goods,
the profit is made by withholding payment to labor.

As I quoted in another message on plug-talk just ten minutes ago, Wilhelm
von Humboldt had something to say about people who work FOR others under
coercion such as wages:

  We may admire what he does [his skill and craft], but we must despise
what he is [for he is a machine owned by a capitalist].

> The difference between the leaders in a capitalist and socialist

> and a socialist is motivated by power.

Wow, talk about narrow views.

The difference between capitalist and socialist society is that a
capitalist society has leaders (see the Thomas Jefferson quote in my
previous message in this thread) and a socialist society does not
necessarily.

What form of power does a person working toward the broad distribution of
power want to keep for himself?  If a person seeks personal power, he is
not a socialist.

In the words of Carl Estabrook,

  To be an anarchist, one must first be a socialist.

In other words, you have to believe in the ability of people to rule
themselves individually before you can remove the tyranny of external
rule.

> Other than that, there's really no difference.  Both lead to
> corruption.

Only if you allow the consolidation of power.  A social-democratic
movement seeks first and foremost the distribution of power.

I swear, you sound like that nut Eric S. Raymond in Revolution OS where he
freaks out and says some nonsense like, "Communism is being FORCED to
share or you get a bullett in the back of your head and they push you into
an unmarked grave or you get life in the gulag or something!"  He has no
idea what he's talking about.  If I had to GUESS, I would think he's sort
of confusing Stalinism with some myth foisted on him by propaganda films
in the 1960s (like the Ad Council's massive "The American Way Of Life"
series).

Freedom and capitalism do not go hand-in-hand.  Moreover, socialism does
not require an ominous and overbearing State to keep it running (but I
think a fair argument can be made that capitalism does).

> There's nothing inherently wrong with motivation, or power, or money,
> or buying and selling on an open market.

Money and power are the same thing under capitalism (i.e., unaccountable
private tyranny).  I don't see how "buying and selling on an open
market" is a motivation for anything at all.

> And I find it hard to not laugh when the people who most claim that

Why is that funny?  If one side should have power over the other, should
it not be the side with the interests of the people doing the work rather
than the side of the owners riding upon their backs?

The curve is already manipulated by private power.  Unionism is just an
attempt to counter-balance the violence of wage-slavery with a democratic
process.

It's true that labor unions can become corrupt, but this is through
willful destruction of the democratic processes that labor movements
attempt to make common by the owners and bosses who despise them.  Unions
that stay democratic do not consolidate power at all and so there is no
corrupting force or motivation.

> I'm for full disclosure and a free market, in case it's not obvious.

Well, if you could find a society that actually developed and moved
forward under free markets and private ownership, I'd be interested to see
it.  Every nation upon which free market principles have been forced today
is living in dire poverty.  The industrialized nations operate under a
system whereby massive amounts of public money is funnelled directly into
the hands of a privileged few in order to prop up their empires.

This usually happens because:

   1) Settings are to aggressive in the BIOS

   2) The memory is having an issue

   3) (Though not as often) A processor is overheating/malfunctioning

Assuming that the BIOS is set to boot to an alternative medium, it is a
hardware issue.

I would first return the BIOS to "fail safe" settings and work your way
up from there.

Machines kind of seem to get in a rut after awhile. When one starts to
shutdown/reboot regularly, funny things can happen until you smooth them
out again.

I googled and saw this page:

Near the bottom of the page, it says something about blowing out old

Well, I was wrong about mine, anyway.  I don't see the source in my source

Subject: [PLUG] wow, dust that baby off and she still works!
Message-ID: <86znrawc5n.fsf@coulee.tdb.com>

In the process of my recent data archeology, I was led to believe that
I might have some old mbox files lying around.  I didn't find them on
my current box, but I thought they just might still be on my
_original_ computer, a 1986-era AT&T PC6300.  It originally came with
an 8 MHz 8086, which was rare back in those days.  I later replaced
the CPU with a NEC V20 or V30 or something, which was a little bit
faster.  It was still in use as recently as 1997, but ever since my
wife got back from grad school with a Pentium 133 box (currently a
firewall) it has been in either a closet or an attic.  For the last 5
years it has sat untouched, gathering dust in the far end of the
attic.

Well, what's to lose!  So I haul it out, plug it in and fire it up.
Monitor comes on (a still-sharp green monochrome), but it hangs at
detecting the HD, a 20 meg "Hardcard".  No problem, I remember well
that the drive had a stiction problem, so I bang it a few times and as
it comes free I can hear it whir up to speed.  Reset button restarts
the boot up.  Hey, it is working!

So, it boots up Microsoft MS-DOS version 3.10, but the autoexec.bat
takes it right to Procomm Plus.  The machine ended its useful life
doing duty as essentially a remote terminal that I could dial-in to
the office with from my apartment.  Alt-Z doesn't seem to get me out.
Maybe I don't have the keyboard plugged in all the way.  Next time I
boot, I just blitz it with Ctrl-C's to interrupt the autoexec.bat.  I
get a prompt.  Must get rid of the damned PCPLUS, so I start wondering
how the hell I used to edit things on this box.  Edlin!  Well, I crank
that up, it starts up, but no "help".  I manage to delete the last two
lines: a CD to the PCPLUS directory and the execution of PCPLUS, but
don't remember how to save.  "w" seems to be the right thing, but it
doesn't seem to work.  I "q" to quit, but I lose the changes.  I try a
few more times, without luck.  Then I remember my normal editor on
this machine was "microemacs", so I run \etc\me c:\autoexec.bat, and
it starts up!  Wow, old home week!  Nuke the two offending lines, save
with the familiar emacs commands and reboot.

I look around.  For a while in the mid-90's, it had been in my
father's possession.  So there are a smattering of his files.  A
supercalc spreadsheet program.  An old DOS Word.  But no mbox's.
Damn.

I also had noticed that there was an ethernet card plugged in the
back.  That must have arrived shortly before it was retired.  I don't
remember ever getting it to work, but I had completely forgotten it
was even there.  I'd even asked Eric Harrison once about NIC's for
these old boxes.  When I plugged in the RJ45, the link light went on.
There is a directory tree on the HardCard copied from an install
floppy.  I look around.  It is apparently an NS2000, whatever that is.
It's got drivers for w95 and NT.  Run the setup program, but the
diagnostics fail, something about an SRAM failure, but I am not sure
the base I/O port is set correctly, so I give up.

Hmm.  I remember a box of floppies, and find them on the shelf.  This
is the first box of double-sided, double-density 360K floppies I ever
owned.  The FUJI Film floppy disk, labelled MD/2D, came in a nice
robust cardboard box.  I probably haven't touched them in even longer
than the machine.  I open the drive latch and give a quick puff of
breath to disarrange the dust a little, and stick in the first floppy.
DIR A:, I type, and I get an error: Abort, Retry, Ignore.  I type "r"
for retry and it works.  The rest of the disks work too, and not just
to read the directories, I pkxarc'd several .arc files to see what was
inside and _that_ all worked.  Annoying thing is I didn't find the
files I was looking for.  Maybe they don't actually exist.  But
frankly, I am amazed it still works.  And those 16 year old floppies!
Pretty impressive.  Now that I've got the poor thing warmed up, it's
probably off back to the remote corner of the attic again.  Sad, so
sad.

Dirk,

  Which packages?

  Here's what I have on a RH 7.3 server/workstation:

[rshepard at salmo ~]$ ls /var/spool
anacron/  cron/  fax/  mail/    postfix/  samba/  up2date/  uucppublic/

Mine in RH 8.0 is as follows;

# ls   /var/spool
anacron       cron  lpd      mqueue   repackage  slrnpull     
up2date     vbox

I didn't mention that I could see the files on the hard drive after
booting from the floppy. So, I know the drive has the stuff it needs on
it, and it works. I just can't boot from it. If what Bill suggested I
try doesn't work, I'll start in on your list.

Thanks for the help.

That held the hint I needed. mac in this case means "message

went into ~/evolution and just moved cert7.db out of the directory and
restarted evolution. That fixed it.

I don't know about their newer boards, but I've had _very_ bad luck with
(a string of) older MSI boards. The KT7 Pro Turbo2, to be specific. The
first two died after about six months each, the third is having
stability problems.

Granted, this has just been for a home play-games & web surf machine, so
it hasn't been that big a deal (unless you ask my family).

Here's a rough outline of the architecture I've got at work:

* MTA: Sendmail 8.12
* Local mailer: procmail

We've got MIMEDefang[1] compiled against the sendmail 'milter'
library. MIMEDefang, a large unwieldy Perl thingee with a C wrapper,
runs in a sort of daemon mode (see: mimedefang-multiplexor), waiting
for messages to scan.

In our setup, MIMEDefang has two subsidiary processes it uses to scan
mail: sophie[2] and SpamAssassin[3]. Sophie scans for viruses,
SpamAssassin for, er, spam. Actually, we don't actually call
SpamAssassin right now; we need to lock down some policies first.

When sendmail receives an inbound message via SMTP, but before it
accepts the message for local delivery or relaying, it hands the
message off to MIMEDefang. MIMEDefang writes the message to a temp
file, unpacks any MIME attachments, and then runs sophie against the
temp file(s) to check for viruses.

If a virus is found, we can do a number of things:

* bounce the message, since we're still within the SMTP transaction 
  and the message hasn't yet been accepted for delivery,

* add a simple warning header but otherwise deliver it as-is,

* rewrite the message to remove the offensive part(s), perhaps 
  replacing the infected part with a 'Virus Alert' notification, and 
  deliver the rewritten message, or

* deliver it as-is.

We currently opt for the rewrite response, though we expect to start
bouncing any and all viruses fairly soon.

If the message isn't infected, then it's is available for spam
checking. If the message is found to be spam, we've got the same
options available as we do when there's a virus: bounce, add a header,
rewrite, or deliver.

Once a message has been accepted for local delivery, then each local
user will then have the ability to invoke spamassassin and procmail
using his/her own rules and disposing of the message as he/she sees
fit.

  cat /var/mail/user1 | formail -s /bin/mail user1 at newcompany.com

All the messages will be there, but the headers and body of the 
originals will appear in the body of the sent messages, and they'll 
all appear to have come from whomever ran formail (e.g., root).

Probably better would be just to tar/zip his inbox and ship it to him 
as a file. Then his mail client can just read the mailbox.

Did you run "fdisk /mbr" (the DOS version) before you rebooted?  This
will rewrite the master boot record, deleting the linux boot loader and
installing the DOS boot loader.  There must also be a boot flag set for
DOS.

Good Luck

If the filenames have no spaces, then the loop isn't too tough:

  for f in $(find . | sort); do
    echo $f | sed -e 's![^/]\+/!\&nbsp;\&nbsp;!g' -e 's!$!<br>!'

Don't forget NorthStar! Should be right at home up at the North Pole.
Unless of course, they reverted to their original name of Kentucky Fried

I checked, and the partition is set as active.

Bingo. I didn't know to do that. Works just fine, now. Thanks for the

They may, but that's no sweat,

	  echo "$f" | sed -e 's![^/]\+/!\&nbsp;\&nbsp;!g' -e 's!$!<br>!'

  sed -e 's![^/]\+/!\&nbsp;\&nbsp;!g'

My Rosetta Stone, where C == command line, E == English translation of 
command line, and N == misc. notes.

  C: sed -e
  E: Hey, sed. I need you to do something for me.

  C: 's!!!'
  E: I'd like you to do some text substitution for me.
  N: Perl just stole this notation, since it was familiar to sed-ites.

  C: [^/]\+/
  E: Look for one or more characters (excluding a forward slash) that
     are followed by a forward slash.
  N: The '+' isn't universally honored by all sed implementations. I 
     know that Sun's sed can't grok it. GNU sed might be unique. In 
     fact, now that I look through the sed texinfo and man pages, I 
     see that the '+' isn't even documented. Wierd. I guess I at some 
     point extrapolated from, e.g., the expr syntax.

  C: \&nbsp;\&nbsp;
  E: Replace that text with "&nbsp;&nbsp;".
  N: The & needs to be escaped lest sed interpret it as what the 
     sed(1) man page calls "the special character &" that refers
     "to that portion of the pattern space which matched."

  C: g
  E: Do that replacement as often as you can on the text you're
     reading.

> And the bangs don't jibe with my book which says "applies the
> command to all lines except the selected ones".

The bangs are just separators for the s/// command; I could just as 
easily have used commas, slashes, carats, hashes, or what-have-you. I 
like exclamation marks because I rarely have them in the text I'm 
matching, unlike forward slashes, which occur all the time in 
filenames.

Wouldn't fetchmail do exactly what needs to be done?

Fetch the mail from the local mailserver then redirect it to port 25 on
the machine for redelivery.

The headers don't get changed by this process, so the "From:" shouldn't be
effected.

The ^ is an exclude when in [ ].  That's why I love this list, every so often,

Message-ID: <20021214013142.525532FEA6@joseph.doink.com>

A friend of mine has his Solaris boxes write messages into log
files when there are soft errors on tape writing.  This way he
can do additional required maintenance on the drive or replace
the tapes.

How can I get my Mandrake 8 (or 9) box to deposit tape write
error messages into /var/log/syslog, or another appropriate log
file?  I've got the standard "write everything at *.info level
or above" into syslog configured in syslog right now.

Thanks....

I think you need to have verbose scsi messages enabled to do this.  Not 
certain if that is enabled by default on Mandrake.

Hey folks...

This doesn't exactly have to do with Linux/Unix, however I was wondering
if anyone has some idea of a place to get upgrade parts / replacement
parts for an old Tek Phaser IISDx. I apparently need to get a code simm
upgrade so that I can give it a hardware address and connect it to my
network with the built in ethernet port... I am having a heck of a time
finding anyone who might have this type of thing.

Any help / suggestions appreciated. If I can get this thing on my
network, I promise to print at least one thing from a Linux or BSD box.
:)


Thanks,

Kaile

I'm not sure if you are aware that Tek sold their printer division to Xerox. 
You might want to surf the Xerox site and see if you can find a contact their 
that might be of help.

Yep, unfortunately, the IISDx is a very old printer, and they don't keep
any kind of parts for it. My only hope is some random printer
"specialist" somewhere. Thanks for the tip though.

Okay, Keven, here you go...

If I understand your question correctly, you are saying, ``Hey, a friend
of mine has this really cool thing on his Solaris box where it outputs
soft tape error messages /var/log/syslog, how can I do the same?''

In that context, here's how...

Let's say that you are using 'tar' to make your backup. Here's how:

tar cvf /dev/st0 / 2>>/var/log/syslog

The important thing here to see is the '2>>/var/log/syslog' part of the
command. This will *append* any messages bound for channel two (error
channel) to the /var/log/syslog file.

If I have mis-interpreted your message please let me know.


Best,


Cooper

That is, of course, a very old printer. As you are probably aware. :-)

And has been pointed out, the Tektronix printer division was sold to
Xerox almost 3 years ago.

Luckily for you, the technical support phone number hasn't
changed. Call 1-800-835-6100 and explain your problem. I would expect
you will have to be escalated to one of the more specialized support
engineers, but I am sure they can help you.

That's almost it.  But, I want any arbitrary command that might 
write to the tape drive to deposit the soft error messages in syslog.
I use tar, BRU, mondoarchive, taper, etc.    I'd prefer if the kernel 
level SCSI driver would do this so I don't have to try and figure out 
how to capture any messages with each utility, if they even pay 
attention to the messages, or if my kernel even spits them out.

Thanks.....

I've had great luck with "the printer place" on Powell and 
17th or so. They're in the book. I don't know if "the dot 
shop" is around, but they could get parts for any ipact 
printer I ever asked for, too.

Thanks for the seducation, that helps.  I'm trying to add the actual href 
string too, but can't seem to figure out how to work it in.  This comes the 
closest,


find $1 . | sort | while read f; do
   href_str='<a href="'"$f"'">'
   echo -n $href_str
   echo "$f" | sed -e 's![^/]\+/!\&nbsp;\&nbsp;!g' -e 's!$!</a><br>!'
done


but yields a leading underline, like
<a href="./Dir_Two">&nbsp;&nbsp;Dir_Two</a><br>

clearly, the $href_str should be inserted within the sed command, but 
nothing I can think of makes it happen where it should.  Looks like sed 
doesn't understand a local var like $href_str.  Do I need to copy that 
string to sed's buffer then copy it to its pattern space?

Also, the sed doesn't seem to have an insert, just an append (which adds a 
newline.  Correct?

I think I'd take a different tack. (Actually, at this point, I'd use 
Perl -- but you've already ruled that out, so ...)

Point one: be careful where you use single (non-interpolating) and 
double (interpolating) quotes.

Point two: I'm unclear how you really want the output to appear. My 
guesses may be way off the mark.

Point three: the output from this script snippet isn't great :-)


find $1 | sort | while read f; do
  # grab the file/directory name, sans leading path
  fname=$(basename $f)
  # see how deep in the directory tree we are by counting
  # the number of /'s in $f
  depth=$(expr $(echo $f | sed 's![^/]!!g') : '/\+')
  # add leading spaces, two per / in $f
  for n in $(seq 0 $depth); do
    echo -n '&nbsp;&nbsp;'
  done
  # build the html, plain font for files, bold for directories
  if [ -d "$f" ]; then
    echo "<b><a href='$f'>$fname</a></b><br>"
  else
    echo "<a href='$f'>$fname</a><br>"

Have you looked in /etc/syslog.conf to see where the various messages are 
being written? The information that your seeking might be written into a file 
that your not expecting. In most cases, and this might not be correct 
depending on the kernel and driver, the message should be a *.kern message 
and probably written to /var/log/messages.

In any case, you might want to look in syslog.conf to make sure.

CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS:

The error messages regarding your SCSI hardware will be easier to
understand if you say Y here; it will enlarge your kernel by about
12 KB. If in doubt, say Y.


CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING:

This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number
of SCSI related problems.

If you say Y here, no logging output will appear by default, but you
can enable logging by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
"Sysctl support" below and executing the command

   echo "scsi log token [level]" > /proc/scsi/scsi

at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

There are a number of things that can be used for 'token' (you can
find them in the source: drivers/scsi/scsi.c), and this
allows you to select the types of information you want, and the
level allows you to select the level of verbosity.

If you say N here, it may be harder to track down some types of SCSI
problems. If you say Y here your kernel will be somewhat larger, but
there should be no noticeable performance impact as long as you have
logging turned off.



Maybe http://evlog.sourceforge.net/why_not_just_use_syslog.html 

CONFIG_EVLOG:

This enables support for enterprise level event logging based upon
the draft POSIX 1003.25 standard. Enabling this feature does not affect
the operation of the sysklogd package in any way. In order to fully
utilize this feature user must also install the companion evlog package
in user-space.

For more information see http://systemras.sourceforge.net

I would use an HTML table to provide the indentation.  You can control 
the width of each table cell.

Downside is that you would probably need two passes, one to determine 
the height of each directory cell (ROWSPAN).
I suppose you could do the recursion with bash functions, and I'm 
surprised no one has suggested that yet.

However, I too would do it in Perl.

:-)

Actually, I don't know enough about various shells to predict how
input redirection would interact with formail's '-s' switch: would
stdin go to formail or to mail? Not wanting to spend much time testing
it under various shells, and hating to become one of those 'of course
you use bash' bigots, I punted and set up a pipe.

If there's a clear rule about when redirection gets set up in *nix 
shells, I'd be happy for someone to set me straight.

Hello Linux folkz,
Could somebody tell me please how to substitute

when it's being sent through the mailing list.
I'm using majordomo and sendmail.
Generally I want to achieve this:
When mailing list recipient is getting mail from the list
he/she should see in the header <From: > the mailing list name
and e-mail address but not the name and address of the sender.

Thank you very much in advance.

Unless the program is only distributed as an RPM, which would require root

 From the article:

"We believe that, beginning in late 2004, Microsoft (and its partners) 
will begin moving some of its (to-date) proprietary application enablers 
(e.g., .Net components) to the Linux environment; this will gradually 
include the major Microsoft back-office products, such as SQL Server, 
IIS, and Exchange," META Group said.

As it says, it's all speculation. Nothing from MS confirms or denies 
what's in the article.

I'll believe it when I see it.

I think that I will replace "pipermail" with this.

I need to figure out a "formail" / "procmail" recipe to take the
existing PLUG archive mbox files and toss them into date separated
piles, perhaps by quarter.

The next thing is to get rid of silly pipermail.

formail -s /bin/mail user1 at newcompany.com <foo

The < is always applied to the command before the command starts.
Therefore, it could never have been data to "formail", and therefore
never anything to do with /bin/mail.  formail doesn't even know,
or care, that redirection has happened, and would have to work really
hard to find out.

Hey all.

I inherited a system that has a really tiny form factor and looks pretty
sweet, but it's only got an IDE controller and a single connector on the
(seemingly) proprietary power supply.  I don't NEED a CDROM or floppy for
the application to which I'd like to put this machine, but I sure would
like to install a usable operating system.  Right now, it has some flavor
of Red Hat with GRUB and I can't figure out how to force it to boot single
user mode without a password so's I can install something useful in the
swap partition and then use that to build a real system on the rest of the
space.

It appears search for a bootp server for a bootable image to tftp, but I
don't know if it's worth configuring all those services for a one-time
install.

Anyone have a quick way to work around this crazy boot loader?

That sort of like clicking "Always Trust Microsoft".  At least the AV coders 
will have a lot of new market growth. In fact, if Meta Group is right we all

stdin is stdin, I think.  Anytime a "cat foo |" would work, so would a "<
foo", e.g.:

  formail -s /bin/mail user1 at newcompany.com < /var/mail/user1

or all interesting shells.

I tried running 'startx' and I got a message about how the lockfile

Have you checked to see if /tmp has space available?  Unlikely I'd guess
given the error message you get, but a full /tmp typically causes all
sorts of things to break.

Check to see whether the partition if full.  If some daemon starting logging 
like mad, for example, /var could become very large very quickly  and, if 
/var and /tmp are on the same filesystem, it could explain your problem.

/var and /tmp are on seperate partitions on this machine.  /tmp is in the
/ partition and /var has it's own partition (not sure why I did it this
way ).  / has at least 150MB free.  But now I can't tell how much is free
in /var since the 'df' command, which worked last night, is now
segfaulting.  This is starting to look like a hardware problem, probably a
hard drive going bad.

Is /tmp its' own partition?  If so take a look at /etc/mtab (or just type 
"mount") and see if was mounted as read only.

Nope, /tmp is under / which is mounted rw.  I can write to other places on
/ as root, but not /tmp.  Also, I found the same problem with /var/tmp
which is on a different partition - can't copy anything in there either.
Hmmm, I was saying in a previous post that I thought it could be hardware,
but I can get to all of my partitions OK and the data looks OK ( at least
as far as I've checked).

you may have been hacked - I had some very similar behavior when I was.
If you're so inclined, check to see if df has been replaced by a
'special' version.

The problem that I just described is a good reason to put /tmp and /var on 
separate partitions.

It doesn't necessarily sound like a hardware problem to me.  If it's a 
hardware problem, you'd expect to see errors related to I/O on the drive 
listed in /var/log/messages.

Here's another suggestion that could be completely misguided.  (I'm sure 
someone will correct me quickly if it is.)  If /tmp lives on an ext2 
filesystem, try checking the file attributes of /tmp using lsattr.  Maybe the 
"i" attribute somehow got turned on for the directory.

One easy thing you can do that might indicate whether you have a trojaned 
version of df is to verify the rpm package that df is part of.  This, of 
course, will only work if the hypothetical attacker hasn't modified the 
checksums recorded in the RPM database or some such.  The command df is in 
the fileutils package.  So, just type

rpm -V fileutils

to verify the package.  See the man page for rpm for the meaning of the 
output.

Just an FYI, some of the more recent root kits install trojaned RPMs
(and/or update RPMS to keep other crackers from exlpoiting the same
holes they used to get in) and if this is the case rpm -V will not find
it.  The best thing to do, assuming you don't have tripwire configured
and installed (or something similar) is to boot say, Knoppix from CD and
use that to mount and inspect your old partitions.  I recently read
about a list of "known-good" md5sums for binaries across a range of
default UN*X Installs (OpenBSD, RedHat, FreeBSD, etc.  there were more,
but that's what I remember) that might be useful.

As long as we're listing "quick and dirty ways to tell if you've been
hacked that might not always work" the best one I've found by far is: 

$ find / -name ...
(using a trusted find, of course) as many, many rootkits still create a
directory called '...' to hide stuff in.  The replaced binaries, of
course, don't list this directory, and even uncompromised binaries may
not list it (it is, after all hidden, and beyond that, how many people
pay close attention to the '.' and '..' entries already present in every
directory?)

Hmmmm.... I was starting to get kind of suspicous that it could be
something like that, but I'm on dialup.  I suppose it's possible to be
hacked on dialup, just seems a bit less likely.

Since we're talking about rootkits, chkrootkit might also be helpful.  See

He has done so implicitly.  It would have said "no space left on device"
if there was not any.  Instead, it says "permission denied".  My guess
is that the "/" is mounted read only.

I have been using "tmpfs" for /tmp with great success.  It works very
well, and there's no need to clear it on reboot.  You can read about it
in the kernel documentation:

http://www.pdxlinux.org/doc/kernel-doc-2.4.18/Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt.gz

Here's what I have in my "/etc/fstab":

/dev/shm	/tmp	tmpfs	size=128m,mode=1777	0	0

Well, so has anyone tried it yet?

Who knows procmail well enough to write the script for it that can toss

If you have exploitable services running on the box that are wide open 
then the box can be hacked on a dialup connection just like it can on 
an ethernet connection. Before I had a broadband connection and was 
using a dialup PPP connection I would see several port probes hit my 
system's firewall when it was connected for any length of time.

If the system is being used as a dialup client, you probably don't need 
to be running much in the way of any services on the system.

The "grepmail" packages might be the expedient thing here.

More in the "wow" retrospective series.  I just found an entry in my

a 687 megabyte ESDI hard disk with controller for _$1950_!  Ouch!  I
had previously been using a 150 meg and had to swap data back and
forth to tape when I switched projects.

Hmm. Well, if you had set the GRUB password, yes.

If you need to get by it, you could use a rescue disk and reinstall the 
master boot record.  I haven't tested this for passwd recovery, but it 
should work.

The first CD of the RH install.

You might not even have to use the 7.3 CD, but even an 8.0.

Follow directions to get to the rescue prompt.

# grub
grub> root (hd0,0)  # Which partition your /boot is at:
                     # This is the same hdc1
grub> setup (hd0)   # This will write the boot sector
grub> quit

Now you shouldn't have to worry about the pesky password.

Bingo.  The 'i' attribute seems to b set for the /tmp dir. So how do I fix

Only root can set this attribute using the chattr command.  See the man page

Yup, I did: chattr -i /tmp
And that did the trick.  And yes, /var/tmp was also set with the i
attribute and that does seem rather malicious.

But then.... after kdm started I notice that there is a new user listed on
the login screen.  The name of the new user is WiNAta - very bizarre!

You've been cracked, without a doubt.  If you haven't already, I strongly 
suggest unplugging the box from the phone line in case the cracker set up 
jobs to dial out and perform some nefarious tasks.  If you know someone on 
the list who is good at forensics, maybe they'd be willing and interested in 
taking a look at it for you before you wipe it.  Otherwise, I suggest 
carefully retrieving whatever important personal files that you can using a 
rescue disk (which won't have trojaned commands), wiping the drive (also 
using a rescue disk), and reinstalling the system.  Check any personal files 
that you want to save very thoroughly to make sure that you aren't going to 
compromise the system with them.  You also might want to change your 
passwords on other boxes where you have might have the same or similar 
passwords.  Furthermore, I suggest setting up firewalling on the system 
before reattaching to the network, eliminating any unnecessary services, and, 
of course, choosing completely different passwords.

If you're interested, you might use a floppy to transfer chkrootkit to the 
system to see what you can learn.  I sent the URL in another message in this 
thread.

I know that some of these are appallingly obvious and I've probably missed 
something vital (that someone else will undoubtedly let me know about soon).  
Sorry that it ended up this way and best of luck in cleaning up the mess.

Mark

P.S. It might not be all bad.  At least it gives you an opportunity to 
upgrade. ;-)

Right.  Use CSS to get layout control!  You can look and see what I've
learned about that by looking over the http://new.pdxlinux.org/ site. 
It uses CSS for styleing and layout control.  Click the CVS link to see
the code.  Modules are in PLUG, and the website is in website.

Why do I always think of things AFTER I send a message?  You can find
some really useful Mozilla sidebars at:

 http://devedge.netscape.com/toolbox/sidebars/

They work in both Mozilla and Galeon.  (Galeon now has Mozilla sidebar
support, look on the Tools menu.)

Good advice.  I had the firwalling script that comes with Mandrake

Yeah, you'll want to configure iptables or ipchains (depending on the vintage 
of Mandrake you're using) by hand.  There are good docs for this purpose on 
the LDP web site and at the netfilter/iptables site.  Since you're only using 
this box as a dial-up client, you might not want to allow any connections 
initiated from the outside.

By the way, what version of Mandrake were you running?

Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it, as I have some important
holiday socializing to do that night.  But, could someone (in addition
to the directions) please indicate what I'll be missing?  We've got a
name from your message, but no topic.  If it's _really_ good, I'll

If I understand your problem, then you should be able to supply a
kernel parameter at boot, e.g.:

  kernel /boot/vmlinuz-X.Y.Z root=/dev/hdaN init=/bin/bash

which will give you a root shell with no password.  Then, all you have
to do is remount your root partition read/write and edit /etc/passwd.
I think that will work.  It seems to on my Debian crashbox.

Message-ID: <20021217053727.15098.qmail@web13802.mail.yahoo.com>

Greetings,

 I have recently gotten into using LaTeX and I'm now
trying to figure out how mess with the DVI files
themselves. I use another program that outputs DVI
files, and I'd like to take two DVI files, {one from
LaTeX and one from the other program) and splice them
together into a larger DVI file. For example, I have
the DVI file from LaTeX that's 4 pages, and the output
from the other program that's 2, I'd like to make it
so that I get a DVI file like this:

Page 1 from LaTeX
Page 2 From LaTeX
Page 1 from other program
Page 3 from LaTeX
Page 2 from Other Program
Page 4 from LaTeX

And other similar things. I'd also like to be able to
extract single pages from DVI files and/or merge
single page DVI files. I've tried freshmeat and
sourceforge with no luck. Any suggestions?

TIA,
Vincent Damewood

The "mmap" man page and the help screens in the Linux kernel "make
menuconfig" say that the IA32 can address 4GB of memory...

Is that physical memory, or virtual memory?  Can it address more than
that amount of virtual memory, but only 4GB at a time, or what?

Since it is a 32 bit architecture, I'm pretty sure it can only address
4 gigs of virtual memory (2^32 == 4gig). I _think_ this is
per-process, so each process could have a 4gig memory space, but I
could easily be wrong there.

As the original message stated, the system in question has no floppy

And only one IDE controller (maybe dual channel or not) with only one
power connector.

Wouldn't think of it.  If I could boot from CD or floppy, I'd just install
Debian.

  Can you provide some information on what and where for the rest of us? I
know nothing about Mandrake's firewall scripts, but I run floppyfw and I'd
like to learn whether or not I'd be vulnerable to the same exploit.

Thanks,

Why was a port related to linuxconf open to the world?  You want multiple 
layers of security.  Two of these layers should be a firewall and up-to-date 
versions of all software behind the firewall.  Since you can block all 
connections initiated outside a machine with a single iptables command, there 
really is no good excuse for not blocking ports that the outside world has no 
business seeing.

4G per process (actually 3 of user space, and 1G of kernel space, you can
hack the kernel to redistribute this a bit, up to about 3.6G user space).
If you enable the 36-bit extension (Intel PAE), you can use >4G RAM up to
64G, but still only 3G per process, so a fully loaded PAE machine with 64G
RAM can run 21 processes of 3G each at the same time, and the remaining 1G
is for the kernel.

How about just putting the harddrive in another system, copy your
distribution of choice (or delete the root password), run lilo (or
grubify it) to create a boot record, then stuff the drive back in?

January.

See you all in 2003!

My suggestion is to try "apt-cache search dvi | less" or use the
searching and limiting features of "aptitude" to look for what you
need.  Then, just "apt-get install" it.  In five minutes you could be
reading the manual page and merging DVI files.

I tell you three (3) times --- If you have not yet looked at "Lurker",
you really really really should do it now.  Don't use old Nescape
Navigator though, use a recent Mozilla or Galeon.  You'll find that the
XML version of the pages works very well.

You will really enjoy the tree view it gives for email threads.  When a
link is yellow, that means it's the start of a thread or that it's a
place where someone changed the subject when they replied to another
message.

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/lurker/message/1040047266.12812.16.camel%40bittersweet.hegbloom.net.xml

For those of you who would rather look at a program than watch
television, have a look at the Lurker source code!  It's a beautiful
site to behold.  This is well written Quality software and a coding
example well worth learning from.  The authors are very well organized;
the code is actually documented and easy to read.  Follow the URL's in
the comments and learn a LOT about B-Trees and AVL trees, for instance.

Some problems I encountered, but think I've fixed:

 o Apache "mod_speling" interferes with Lurker's CGI setup.  It hooks
   the request process and delivers a "Multiple choices" error when you
   try to access a page that's not been generated yet, but for which
   there is already one with the same prefix; that is, written by the
   same person and thus having the same Message-Id prefix.  Turning off
   "mod_speling" fixed the problem.

 o lurkerd uses "fcntl" advisory locking on the mbox files, but I don't
   think that "pipermail" (from Mailman) is doing any locking.  I wonder
   if that's going to cause any trouble or not?  The Debian Policy Manual
   mandates that mbox locking be done in an NFS safe fashion using a
   certain algorithm and a "$MBOXNAME.lock" file.  Perhaps lurkerd should
   be patched to support that?  I wonder if "procmail" can use fcntl style
   locking or not?

Any feedback or ideas concerning Lurker and the PLUG lists?

They were in the order received:

1. Rich Magdelain, Source One, (503) 670-4808, rmagdelain at source1inc.com
2. Grabar - 60th and Banfield Fwy.

I couldn't verify the existence of second one. I couldn't find them in the

GrayBar is a huge place (Gray with white letwring).
You can see it on the north side of I-84.
You can also get rack equipment from Platt Electric
and WrightLine (Linda Bertwell 503-292-6620).

                        <rw_azpower at yahoo.com>

      Rob is coming to Portland to give a talk on his work on
      building a completely Open Source Linux PDA based on
      the Hitachi H8S microprocessor.
      See http://www.azpower.com/H8-uClinux for details.

      Rob is looking for developers to participate in the project
      and as I understand he will have a couple H8S-2674R boards
      to give to people interested in working on the project.

      **********************************************************

          Agenda:

              We don't really have an agenda at this meeting.
              But, remember Paddy's is giving us the room for
              the food and drinks we order during the meeting.

Found them. The original tip had the wrong name. Grabar is in actual word
in Spanish, although an odd one to be associated with this sort of business. 
(Verb: to engrave or record.) It's also a proper name, so I figured it might
be right.

time I have a hard return, the HTML output has a <p> tag wrapping the

Print to a file (postscript), cleanup as necessary with a text editor,
use gv to test the postscript, then use ps2pdf.  That's what I do.

That seemed to do the trick.  Thank you.  Unfortunately, the question is
rather moot since Word seems to have trouble reading files saved from
OpenOffice and abiword.  The abiword version looks like rtf or
something, and the OpenOffice version brings up the file conversion
dialogue in Word2000.  
Is there another trick for interoperability?  Like shift-saveas or
something? :)

I don't know if you can select pages from multiple DVI files, but there is a program, dvitodvi, that lets you select, reorder, and otherwise manipulate pages within a single file.

Greetings,

 I have recently gotten into using LaTeX and I'm now
trying to figure out how mess with the DVI files
themselves. I use another program that outputs DVI
files, and I'd like to take two DVI files, {one from
LaTeX and one from the other program) and splice them
together into a larger DVI file. For example, I have
the DVI file from LaTeX that's 4 pages, and the output
from the other program that's 2, I'd like to make it
so that I get a DVI file like this:

Page 1 from LaTeX
Page 2 From LaTeX
Page 1 from other program
Page 3 from LaTeX
Page 2 from Other Program
Page 4 from LaTeX

And other similar things. I'd also like to be able to
extract single pages from DVI files and/or merge
single page DVI files. I've tried freshmeat and
sourceforge with no luck. Any suggestions?

I wonder if "catdoc" or "antiword" will help solve the problem?

What is Google and why don't you ask there?

Mozilla (and thus Galeon) supports XML / XSLT, so you can click the link
for the XML version if you like, or just let the redirect take you to
the HTML version.  The difference is that with the HTML version, the
"xsltproc" is run on server side, but with the XML version, the browser
downloads the .xsl stylesheets, and renders the XML into HTML itself, on
client side.

I posted that by clicking the <reply> link on the Lurker page.  Galeon
is configured to call "evolution" when I do that...  What I don't know
is if other mailers will exhibit the same problem or not?  Is it
Lurker's fault, or Evolution's?

So, will someone NOT using Evolution as your mailer please Reply to this
message via the Lurker page?  Once again, it's:

 http://lists.pdxlinux.org/lurker/

... and XML works in Mozilla, Galeon, and probably MSIE.

RedHat removed Xconfigurator from it's version 8.0, and replaced it
with redhat-config-xfree86. Problem is, redhat-config-xfree86 seems to
need X to run, since it runs in graphical mode. That seems useless to
me, as you have to have X running to fix X...

Is there another program similar to Xconfigurator that will work in
RedHat 8, or is there a way to run redhat-config-xfree86 in text mode?

I can click the "open xml version of this site" and it looks fine.  Just 
curious why it thinks my browser is incapable.  Ran across a simliar glitch 
at the ifilms site while trying to view the "Revolution OS" trailer.  I had 
to insist that I have RealPlayer, it sort of worked, but I figured it was 
their server being MS-centric.

Maybe Mozilla's just shy and doesn't want to discuss its abilities.

Subject: [PLUG] Crash recovery -- your choice(s)?
Message-ID: <20021218034718.EE0012FEA6@joseph.doink.com>

I want a "good" crash recovery and backup solution.  "Good" means:

  - full and incremental backups to media of my choice, tape
    preferred, CDR or CDRW maybe

  - After a crash I boot from floppy or CD, maybe with new
    hardware, and what's on the floppy formats, partitions and
    asks me for my backup media.  Then the loaded software
    restores from my backup media, maybe asking me for subsequent
    volumes, and tells me "all is well, remove the floppy and
    reboot now" or something like that.

  - media verification at backup time is a must.

  - verification at restore time is a must.

I've tried two solutions "BRU with CRU" (from Tolis Group) and
"Mondo" (open source).

  - Using CRU (Crash Recovery Utility) with BRU (Backup and
    Restore Utility), when I recover I got as far as
    "Loading............" (not sure about the number of dots)
    when rebooting after the restore stage.

  - I've never managed to get mondo-restore to work on my
    Mandrake 9.0 system.  I've been on the developer list for
    this, but the solution doesn't seem present at this point.
    Lots of other people swear by Mondo, but I can't get it to
    work yet.  The last error I got was a kernel panic when
    booting what had been restored.

There are lots of backup packages available for Linux, but I'd
prefer one that's got forthought into crash recovery as well.
What are you using and what would you recommend in this context?

Thanks much folks....

I think it's Evolution not supporting the "heavy" mailto: link that
Lurker spits out.  It looks like Lurker is tacking on the "In-reply-to"
and "References" headers in an attempt to maintain threading but
Evolution isn't decoding and adding them correctly to the email headers.

Er, sort of.  From what I understand on the Linux kernel mailing list, the 
actual feasible amount is 16GiB.  This is due to the size of the page 
tables apparently.  They take up too much room for 64GiB in the standard 
kernel mapping space.  I didn't follow the whole thing very carefully, so 
YMMV.  16 or 64GiB, if I ever have a computer even capable of having that 
much RAM, then I'll worry about it :-)

As Fedor says, each user process is limited to a maximum of 4GB of virtual 
memory, but physical memory can be larger (weird, yes, but what do you 
expect from this many layers of patches on the x86 architecture?).  In 
addition, the kernel is mapped into the memory space of each process.  
That takes some away from the space the process can use.  You can 
configure the ratio of kernel space to user space from 1:3 to 3:1.  I 
think it is normally set for 1:3 which, as Fedor said, is 1 GiB of space 
for the kernel mappings and 3GiB for the user process.

Where do the extra bits come from to form the full 36-bit address?  Is that 
something you stick into the page table entries somewhere?  Another of the 
CRx registers?

Best,
Kyle

X -configure works, IIRC.  It should do good enough to get you to where
you can get in and run RH's clicky config program.

I like editing the XF86Config file by hand, myself.  :-)

I've used BackupEDGE (http://www.microlite.com) but not in all the

a Linux upgrades that _*failed*_ and was able to recover the systems.
   As a backup system I don't care for it as much as I do for BRU.  BRU 
has very easy to use command line options that make scripted backups 
easier.

Try this in text mode:
Redhat-config-xfree86 --reconfig        To NOT use settings saved when run
last.
Then run Redhat-config-xfree86 and choose "svga".
They don't have alot of the newer drivers so it barfs on the higher end
setups.

The script isn't exactly what I wanted, but the two
programs it uses are. My problem now is compiling
dviconcat. It uses an odd kind of makefile called an
'Imakefile' (whatever that is), I tried running the
script noImake, but the Makefiles it created are a
total nightmare, using out dated and system-specific
variables. I'd rebuild one from scratch, but the build
process is horridly under-documented! Any suggestions?

Sincerely,

That's not what it is.  It's this:

 <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="browserdetect.js"></script>
 <script language="JavaScript">
<!--
if (browser.isIE6up==true) {document.location.href='splash/index.xml'; }
-->
</script>

There's not a line there for Gecko based browsers.  I'll fix it.

Will everyone please try it, and hit it with every browser you've got,
then report works / doesn't work to me, so I can add them?

We have IE >= 6, Galeon and Mozilla (Gecko).  What about the KDE one and
Opera?  And I bet that Amaya can do it too.

Right; like perhaps Evolution is not correctly URL decoding the mailto

This thing is just totally amazing!  Look at this:

It took under 5 minutes to index all of those messages.  Soon we must
add the older archives to it also.

Any other lists we should hook into this thing, for our convenience?

(notice edit of citation - pertinent portion restored.)

http://lists.pdxlinux.org/lurker/

xml detection is now good for mozilla 1.0.1

Looks reasonably useful.  Tried a few searches; it would be nice if 
splash/index.xml didn't reset the search boxes when returning to the page so 
you can modify your previous search.  Though, you can add critera to the 
single box provided on subsequent pages--which seems to look at "subject" 
and "author" (or does sb: mean search body?)

For example, you can search for a subject then append an author's name to 
the search and the output is further refined.  But clicking the big 
"Lurker at lists.pdx.org" link at the top of the page (which looks deceivingly 
like it would bring up a mailto: instead of returning to the home page) 
nukes your search.

Just nits.  Thanks Karl.

Cheers,
Kyle Accardi

The url bar at the top that normally tells you where in the web you are

completely ignored, although the text sticks.

Anyone else seen this?

A data point...
this worked, disable Java and XSLT (Preferences | Advanced), close the 
browser.  Upon relaunching, the bar is back.  Can now also re-enable those 
two and it stays happy.

Updated FlashPlayer recently, maybe mozilla didn't like having its config 
files man-handled by the post-install script.

This isn't really correct.  When I launch mozilla, it brings up email and 
the browser.  The temporary fix is to close and re-open the browser, while 
leaving the email client running.

If all mozilla components are closed then restarted, the empty url bar is 
back.  Has nothing to do with Java or XSLT.

Dirk,

As root, do one of the following:

  lsof -i :515

Is there anything already bound to that port?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212191627410.11135-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I had to shut down my client workstation to replace the video card. Since
it came back on the network we can no longer print _anything_ from it. The
printers are physically attached to the server host, and the client's been
configured properly before.

  On the no-longer-functioning machine there is no /usr/sbin/printers so I
don't know how to diagnose the problem and fix it. I've stopped and
restarted cupsd but that makes no difference.

  Has anyone some suggestions I can try?

Thanks,

Rich

Here are some things to try:

 1) understand how the system works;
  
 2) think about how all the parts of the system interact;

 3) think about what parts might have stopped working;

 4) check and confirm that they are still working the way they are
    supposed to;

 5) when you find something that is not working, fix it and then go to
    step 1. Repeat until desired function is restored.

I have edited the line in cups-lpd to disable=no and done a xinetd

Perhaps you should upgrade to a newer release of Mozilla and see if the
problem persists.  Many of us are using 1.2 now, and find that it's
working quite well.

Subject: [PLUG] [Off-Topic] Free Software Consortium in search of Consultants and Agents in your area.

http://www.fsconsortium.com

On the main page you will find links to subscribe as consultant and/or agent.

Free Software Consortium is a multinational consortium established to link the
companies and the independent consultants that use and promote free software.

One of the bigger obstacles to the development of the free software services
market is the fear of many companies to establish contracts with independent
consultants who do not have support of a well known Company, Corporation or
Consortium.  Questioning quality, support, experience and capability to
successfully complete a project are the companies manager's main concerns when
considering the option of migrating their systems to free software.

Like you, we know the excellent quality that Free Software offers.
We have complete confidence that Free Software is going to be the platform of
the future. That is why it's so important to work and consolidate together to
solve the problem mentioned above.

Free Software Consortium intends to fill this void joining the best free
software companies and consultants at the national and international level.

By joining to Free Software Consortium you or your company will have the
following benefits:

1. Possibility of being hired by other Consortium members.
2. Possibility of hiring other Consortium members.
3. Use of the Consortium image and name with your clients.
4. Use of the Consortium's resources like Publicity Brochures, Business Cards,
Banners for presentations and events, financial presentations, publicity
articles for the press and magazines, support via mailing list and forums with
the Consortium's members, marketing and communication assistance, CD's and
manuals from the Consortium, site and mail hosting (yourarea.fsc.cc) and other
future services.
5. Representation of the FS Consortium in your area to share administrative,
legal and marketing resources between the Consultant members in your area.

Free Software Consortium will establish a contract with an Agent company which
will have exclusive representation in it's area, in charge of organizing the
consultants in the area.  This Agent company will provide the administrative
services, marketing and sales with the local customers.

>From the business generated by the Free Software Consortium, the Agent company
will receive 20% of the value of the contract, and the Consultant or 
Consulting
company will receive 80%.

The Free Software Consortium is developing a new business model and invites 
you
to join as a founding member and contribute in developing this new business
model.  We need your valuable help to give us ideas and comments. Please write
to info at fsconsortium.com


Thank you for your attention.

Thank you for that.  It's a lot easier to follow the thread of
conversation when there is less clutter.  Think of this once.  What if
we had a blind person who wanted to take part in the discussion through
the use of a screen reader program?  Wouldn't be nice to not hear all
that extra stuff every time over and over?

Great.  I will go ahead and mail in my patch to the Lurker developers
then.

Your browser back button drop down should work just fine for that, don't
you think?

The search engine narrowing constraint keywords are documented here:

But the back button does work.

This idicates to me that perhaps you have not installed the BSD LPD
compatiblity server portion of cupsys.

What do your logs indicate?  Was a connection ever made?  Can you
connect on that port with netcat (nc)?  Have you tried a network sniffer
to see if it's trying?

You might try a google search also... though I imagine you've already

Not for me.  Every way I can get back to the home page, makes it look brand 
new--blank.

[Earlier today, I was using "cvs" (w/o quotes) in the subject and getting 
some hits.  Now I get none.  Also search my name in the author field, again 
nothing.  Perhaps you're doing something at the moment--17:48 PST]

Searching now works again.

More info: If I disable XSLT support in my browser and go to the .html 
version of the front page, returning to it after a search retains the search 
keywords.  Perhaps XSLT is broken in my mozilla...

Same results with Galeon linked to libraries from Mozilla 1.2, so it's
not just you.  (I had not actually TRIED the back button previously.
duh)

Will you report it to Mozilla bugzilla, or shall I?

OK. I had VMware installed on a system once, but haven't messed with
it lately. Thanx.

Oh good. But no good. I found the app on my system, and launched it.
But it wouldn't list the files I have in the 'open dialogue' box. So I
tried launching it as "kword file.wpd" and it brought up a box saying
"Can't open file application/wordperfect". At least it knew the file
type.

The help box lists kword as version 1.1.1, and lists the app home
page.

And now I see that they have a version 1.2.1 out....  Ahhh, the world
of constant upgrades. I guess it really is worse on other OS's!  :)

Hmmm. The update has an rpm for RH7.3, and I'm running 7.2; I'm
concerned about downloading a 25MB package, and then having it not
work.....

Building from source looks equally problematic, and now I'm off to
work. More later tonite.

Tyler,

For the ne2000 module, you will need to bring down your ethernet device
first:

   ifconfig eth0 down
   rmmod ne2000

For the rest, try using the -r switch to remove the stack the module
might be in. The sb16.o module, for example relies on at least two other
modules that are loaded in the stack.

If that doesn't work, try to figure out the module stack manually and
work your way down. You can do this by looking at the depmod (module
dependancy) information in /lib/modules/[kernel_version]/modules.dep.
Work your way from the top down.

It may be, as is likely the case with the ne2000 module, that the module
is in use. This will make removing the module impossible.

You can, however, prevent the module from loading at the next boot by
editing the appropriate lines in /etc/modules.conf and/or
/etc/modules.autoload.

That statement is true, but until CSS came around, tables were all we
had:  and for some things, they still are.  If I were to adhere to your
statement, Jeme, I would not be a very effective Web developer.
Positioning in CSS is still relatively young, so you have compatibility
problems to begin with, whereas HTML tables--while still hopelessly
flawed--are yet much more mature and stable.  And consequently there are
a number of tricks which can still only be done effectively with
tables--especially if you prefer "stretchy" sites to fixed-width
layouts, like me.

My question, though, is whether CSS is the answer to the layout problem.
    I don't think so.  I just don't see the descriptive language in CSS
to handle complex layout.  Just to get firmly off-topic, it's too easy
to become enamoured of some interface or other and to use it
inappropriately--hence the problem with HTML in general.  So the issue
with CSS, as usual, is scope.  I think we should separate "layout" from
"style"; and positioning on the page, especially "absolute" positioning,
seems to transcend mere "style".  Moreover, absolute positioning implies
overlapping rectangles, rather than concentric ones, so the whole
paradigm of HTML is warped here, if not altogether adulterated.  Don't
get me worng, absolute positioning, espressed both in pixels and
percentage of the client window dimensions, without using tables, is
something HTML always needed.  I just don't think it should be done with
CSS either.  If you have a rectangle, the inner spacing around its
contents is a "style" attribute easily enough; but to control the
placement of that rectangle (DIV tag) with its style looks right 
backward to me.  It's one way of doing it, sure, but it seems like bad 
design, in my opinionation.

But then my solution would be to cast off HTML entirely, tattered and
war-torn standard that it is.  A simpler, leaner browser interface
should be possible with XML (I know HTML now conforms to XML, but it
still sucks hopelessly) and CSS, with its own language for positioning
things sensibly and flexibly, and without all the style-based tags.
Anyone seen such a creature?

On my RH 8 box, I get this:

  [heinlein at debs heinlein]$ which lsof
  /usr/sbin/lsof
  [heinlein at debs heinlein]$ rpm -qf /usr/sbin/lsof 
  lsof-4.63-2

It's a handy utility; I'd recommend installing it if you're not short 
of disk space.

If you can't install lsof, you can still use netstat:

  netstat -anl | grep -w 515

That'll at least tell you if your machine is already trying to listen
to something on port 515 -- though, unlike lsof, it won't tell you
what program is bound to the port.

  That's interesting, Paul. On my RH 7.3 box the 'which' command doesn't
find lsof, only 'locate' does. Strange. I've tried it as a user as well as

That means that /usr/sbin isn't in the path of whichever user you are

  Right. And, for whatever reason, /usr/sbin/ is not in anyone's path here.
Should it be? I don't know that it ever has been.

Thanks, Matt,

Usually it is only in root's path since /usr/sbin contains mostly
administrator utilities that require root to function properly.

lsof is in my path (but it's in /usr/bin), and I'm just a regular user. 
I'm using slackware 8.0, and lsof came from the lsof.tgz package.

   After the Elcomsoft acquital, now what?

   If the debate over the misnamed Digital Millennium Copyright Act
   (DMCA) has taught us anything, it's how productive you can be with a
   decent helping of pigheaded optimism. Remember a year ago, when Dmitry
   Sklyarov went home to Russia? On Tuesday, his employer, Elcomsoft, was
   acquited in the first DMCA criminal case.

   On December 14 of last year, Danny O'Brien wrote:

     They said that a bunch of geeks waving placards would do nothing to
     free DMITRY SKYLAROV. And they said that whining about obscure
     Net-torturing provisions in already drafted legislation would
     change nothing. And we believed them, too. It's lucky that other
     people are more foolishly optimistic than that. After all, it'd be
     fair to claim that adverse publicity of the Skylarov case
     contributed heavily to everyone's DMCA poster-boy being released
     yesterday: especially Adobe's boycott-prompted wish that Dmitry's
     prosecution be dropped. And while UK government defeats during the
     final stages of legislation are almost unheard of, the data
     retention clause in the Anti-Terrorism Act was one of the few to
     get shot down. Out goes the condition that ISP logs can be kept and
     examined for detecting any crime. Now, as heavily lobbied by those
     "aery-faery" and naive civil libertarians, it has to be proper
     *terrorist* crime. Mr Blunkett, in conceding the amendment,
     commented that the logs would have to be kept anyway, to see
     whether they were terrorists or not, and "that is how stupid the
     Liberal Democrats [and their Tory supporters, presumably] are."
     Let's see how stupid the human rights judges, and the Data
     Protection folk are when they get to work on this. Meanwhile,
     here's to another year of stupid protestors and their clearly
     impossible victories.

   http://www.ntk.net/2001/12/14/:
   http://www.ntk.net/2001/12/14/

   "Clearly impossible victories." That's right. Put that in your pipe
   and smoke it, all you apolitical "geeks should stick to code"
   weiner-heads.

   Here's to another victory. Two weeks ago, in this newsletter, I
   predicted:

     "Power lawyer Joseph Burton will get Elcomsoft off in the first
     criminal DMCA trial by appealing to the jury's reason and sense of
     fairness. The prosecution will be unable to justify this irrational
     law, and won't try -- they'll use dumb, simplistic "copying is
     stealing" analogies that will make the jury feel patronized, and
     that Burton will defeat with fair use examples. This will infuriate
     DMCA proponents and cause a huge party in San Francisco."

   It happened. The jury voted to acquit Elcomsoft.

   Look at the news reports at http://news.google.com/news?q=elcomsoft:
   http://news.google.com/news?q=elcomsoft and you'll see that there are
   two possible interpretations of this.

   Interpretation 1: The acquital was a breathtaking Jury Nullification
   of the DMCA, showing once and for all that ordinary Americans won't
   stand for counterintuitive laws that take power away from ordinary
   people and give it to the copyright cartels. Yes, a jury can vote to
   acquit if they just think a law is unjust. Prosecutors can never bring
   a DMCA case again, except against someone who is also a real
   infringer, since the law violates readers' expectations of access to
   copyrighted works they own.

   Interpretation 2: The acquital was a fine feat of lawyer-fu by Joseph
   Burton, but fair use was never an issue -- whether or not Elcomsoft
   made a "willful" violation of the law was. Innovators had better watch
   out because future DMCA prosecutions can come at any time!

   The Business Software Alliance now _seems_ to advocate Interpretation
   1 publicly! In a statement, the organization said, "The DMCA has clear
   criminal penalties that can and should be imposed in cases of direct
   or attempted theft of software and other digital content." (
   http://www.bsa.org/usa/press/newsreleases//2002-12-17.1398.phtml ):
   http://www.bsa.org/usa/press/newsreleases//2002-12-17.1398.phtml

   So I asked for a clarification. BSA spokesperson Jeri Clausing
   replied, "WE would like to see the criminal provisions applied in any
   case of alleged violation of the DMCA."

   Any case. That's right, BSA members don't want to pay their own
   lawyers to bring a civil case -- they want your and my tax dollars to
   pay to suppress fair use.

   But realistically, this isn't going to happen. Prosecutors tried the
   DMCA, and failed. DMCA proponents can't spin this verdict to make it
   look like just a technicality. US Attorneys won't touch another DMCA
   criminal case with an eleven-foot pole unless they can hang something
   else on the defendant too. They won't jeopardize their win/lose
   records by attacking another DMCA-only defendant with this weak law.
   Look at how the prosecutor slunk away in shame after this one.

   So DMCA proponents desperately don't want you to believe
   Interpretation 1. They want you to believe Interpretation 2. But I
   know the "technicality" interpretation is all wrong because the jury
   was AWAKE and INTERESTED at the end of the trial. The definition of
   "willful"? What a stretch! Only the law reporter for the Dubuque Star
   could be interested in this. For the love of God, people, the jury
   asked for a copy of the DMCA! The foreman said, in what I'm sure will
   be this week's most quoted quote of the day, "Under the eBook formats,
   you have no rights at all, and the jury had trouble with that
   concept."

   How much The Jury Thought the DMCA Is Bogus do you need here? Will
   this do you?

   The Jury Thought the DMCA Is Bogus.

   The Jury Thought the DMCA Is Bogus.

   The Jury Thought the DMCA Is Bogus.

   After carefully comparing both interpretation 1 and interpretation 2,
   I have come to the conclusion that Interpretation 1 is true, this is a
   huge win for our side, and we should all (1) party, and (2) take
   further action in the New Year.

   Action? Glad you asked. I'm not going to wait for another DMCA
   prosecution -- see the part about the eleven-foot pole above. Here's
   what I'm planning to do. Please join me.

   In prosecuting this case, and justifying the prosecution of this case,
   the DMCA proponents have said that it's about infringement (well, they
   say "stealing" but that's not the correct term here. Ask your local
   librarian where in the reference section they keep Black's Law
   Dictionary if you don't believe me.) If this is about prosecuting
   infringers, make it about prosecuting infringers, right? Which brings
   us to...

   DMCA reform now! We must strike while the iron is hot! And the iron is
   like center-of-the-Earth hot here, people!

   If the DMCA is about infringement, let's hold them to it, and make it
   about infringement.

   Look up your Representative in Congress, get on his or her announce
   list, and commit to attending his or her first constituent meeting of
   the new year. Why the House? Because the Senate gets more money from
   the DMCA-mongers, and because DMCA reform started in the House last
   time, although it was too late to go anywhere.

   Here is my Representative's Town Hall page:
   http://www-eshoo.house.gov/townhall.html:
   http://www-eshoo.house.gov/townhall.html

   I am going to hit reload on that sucker until a meeting happens, then
   I'm going to go, invite all my freedom-loving friends to go, and ask
   for DMCA reform. In the meantime, you should never ask for something
   unless you can write down what you want in one page, so see below for
   a sample letter.

   Now, let me make one thing very clear. None of your DMCA reform
   advocacy is wasted, if anyone hears about it, because anyone could end
   up on a jury.

   Even if we don't _get_ DMCA reform, loudly _calling_ for DMCA reform
   is going to do what the DVD cases and Dmitry's arrest did -- get the
   problems with the DMCA out in the public's face, and call the whole
   idea of banning fair use in the name of copyright into question.

   You know how it was just "the DMCA" in the paper until Dmitry's
   arrest, then it became "the controversial DMCA"? That's because we
   previously made noise about the DVD cases! Even though one of the DVD
   cases ended unfavorably, and the other is still in the legal system,
   your vocal cords were not damaged in vain.

   So here's what I want, and you should ask for it too ( change the
   California stuff to something relevant to your Representative. Then
   get down to that constituent meeting!)

   The Honorable Anna Eshoo
   698 Emerson Street
   Palo Alto, California 94301

   Dear Representative Eshoo:

   The recent acquital in the trial of the software firm Elcomsoft shows
   that a jury of our fellow Californians believes the anticircumvention
   provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) are unfair.
   It is now clear that the DMCA needs reform.

   The anticircumvention provisions should be applied only in the case of
   actual copyright infringement, not as a weapon for copyright-holding
   industries to use against innovators who develop new software for
   business and education.

   While a few vocal lobbyists for the publishing industry defended the
   prosecution of Elcomsoft, others say that the DMCA has gone too far in
   prosecuting software developers instead of actual copyright
   infringers. William Pollock, founder of No Starch Press, wrote last
   year, "While I am certainly opposed to the illegal copying and sale of
   books, I think the government should spend more time prosecuting the
   real offenders: The people and companies who make and sell illegal
   copies of books, not the software tool developers."

   Representative Zoe Lofgren's Digital Choice and Freedom Act of 2002
   was a welcome reform that would have allowed the DMCA's
   anticircumvention provisions to apply only in the case of actual
   infringement, while removing the law's chilling effect on software
   innovators who deliver useful products.

   Please join our 16th district neighbor in sponsorship of this
   legislation when the 108th Congress convenes next month. It is a
   necessary reform to support the innovation and free speech that are so
   vital to our area.

   Sincerely,
   Donald B. Marti Jr.

   Linux Journal is hiring a staff writer.

   If you want to work for Linux Journal, please see the job posting
   at:http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6520:
   http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6520

   I can't say what I'm hoping to assign to this person, but let me warn
   you that this job will get you used to doing "less /proc/cpuinfo"
   instead of "cat /proc/cpuinfo"

   Microsoft to port to Linux?

   This is the most bogus Linux story since "(name of Linux company here)
   is the new Microsoft". Let me tell you why.

   First of all, there are basically three ways to do server software.

   1. 100% Pure Java. Obey Sun. Count on "write once, debug everywhere"
   to make it possible to deploy on multiple platforms with minimal pain.
   Key advantage are: "It's not Microsoft" and "There are lots of
   relatively inexpensive contract programmers who can do this".

   2. Whatever Microsoft wants you to do this year. You get a
   full-featured integrated development environment in exchange for tying
   yourself to APIs that are more and more difficult to port away from.
   If you use their tools out of the box without paying specific
   attention to portability, you're locked in. One Unix programmer
   pointed that use of Microsoft Foundation Classes in a large C++
   project made the planned "port to Linux" a near-total rewrite instead.
   I'm not saying that you can't use Microsoft tools to do a portable
   program, just that once you decide to do so you're basically following
   choice number 3, which is...

   3. Target a cross-platform environment, not a single platform. (I have
   a whole rant about "targets" and "platforms" and why one should rarely
   be the other.) This is probably the best decision, since it gives you
   the most flexibility. You can make a choice to deploy on another
   platform relatively easily. If you've practiced good habits, many
   would say more easily than with Java. However, there's still a
   question of which cross-platform toolkit.

   But we were talking about Microsoft and porting to Linux, which is a
   story with surprising endurance.
   http://news.google.com/news?q=microsoft+linux+meta:
   http://news.google.com/news?q=microsoft+linux+meta

   Which way do you think they wrote their server software? In Java?
   Naah. With plans all along to port it? Naaah. So they've almost
   certainly got a bunch of essentially unportable software.

   Rewrite? They could afford to -- they certainly have done several
   products that have the same name, different internals. But in that
   case they're basically releasing a brand-new product with none of the
   testing record of the old ones.

   They can cheat, and graft a big Windows compatibility layer into their
   software so it runs natively but slowly on Linux, but in that case,
   they're essentially giving you Windows for no charge. So why not just
   cut the price of Windows, and reduce the amount of coding they have to
   do for the same result?

   Much more likely than "Microsoft to port to Linux" is "Microsoft OS OS
   license fees to fall under price pressure from Linux". Let's see the
   analysts research that one.

   Finally, AUP frenzy

   In the last issue of this newsletter, I complained about ISP
   Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) that ban you from setting up a public
   WiFi access point. Michael "mikeraz" Rasmussen from the Personal Telco
   Project of Portland wrote in to say,

   "Qwest is concerned with harmful (cracking, spamming) or legally
   sticky (abusive, threatening, pornographic, illegal) content. No
   mention is every made of bandwidth usage by persons other than the
   Qwest customer. All mentions of objectionable use fall into the two
   categories just described.

   "In short, legal use of bandwidth is permitted without respect to the
   party/computer doing the using.

   "Frankly I'm surprised there is no reference to 'not for resale.'

   "The AUP does not address or mention bandwidth sharing."

   Hooray for Qwest, and thanks, mikeraz.

There's something we could do on the PLUG server to make it help pay for
itself.  I think we'd want a faster box for it then though...

I've got a patch for BIND 9 that will make doing this sort of thing a
little easier.  It makes the named.conf "include" directive accept a
directory or a file, rather than only a file.  If you give it the name
of a directory, it includes every file in that directory.  This way, the
named.conf snippet for a particular domain can be just dropped into a
file of it's own to add it.  That will make management of boxes with
lots of DNS domains a little more modular.

The fundamental flaw of the xhtml/css model is the
assumption that you can separate form from content, style
from substance, etc.  It's not that it's impossible to do
so, the problem is there isn't necessarily a _right_ way to
do so, and an insistence that everyone conform to a
particular idea of what's content and what's presentation is
going to cause problems.

xhtml/css is an improvement over table-layout html, but it's
still far from right.  css2 has some narrow assumptions
about page layout that puzzle me.  I often find that what I
have in my mind for layout, something I think is simple and
device-independent and easy to do in, say, PostScript, turns
out to be impossible to get right in css2.  So I end up
dreaming to css2's limitations, which usually means I do
very minimal designs that don't really need much of css2's
capabilities.

Device-independent layout is a hard problem.  I think it's
going to need a full programming language to do a good job
of it.  PostScript could do it easily, it already solves
most of the problems.  Someone just needs to spend some time
designing a structure for generic separation of data from
presentation.  That's the easy part.  The hard part is
convincing people to use it.

I am looking to purchase a CHEAP SSL Cert (preferably NOT from verisign)
for SSL encryption for a web site.  We're talking cheap like less than
$50/year.

I've looked in http://www.cacert.org, but the site doesn't make it look
like they'll be around for years to come, and I'm not sure if they are in
the list of CA's that popular browsers support.  In fact in IE when I go
to their SSL site that's signed by them it says it's not signed by a
trusted CA.

Does anyone have any recommendations?

I believe you're not going to find a really cheap SSL cert that's
recognized by all browsers - I went looking a few months ago and the
cheapest I found was around $150/year; I'll see if I can find my notes
if you're interested.  Overall I think an extra $100/year isn't
unreasonable to pay so customers don't get scary looking dialog boxes
popping up.  If it's just for internal use, or with groups that can
handle an explanation of what the scary dialog box is, you can generate
your own one for free, you don't get a 3rd 'neutral' party that will
confirm that you are who you say you are, but you will get SSL
encryption.

Yeah it's for commercial use, so I can't have scary dialog boxes coming
up.  What is the CA you found that is $150/year?

I think the one I found for $150-ish was Entrust
(http://www.entrust.com) which seems to have a pretty good reputation.

Just now though I found InstantSSL (http://www.instantssl.com/) that has
them as low as $69/year and claims high compatability with browsers (it
appears as if the CA is really comodo.net via GTE CyberTrust which
appears to be trusted by my browsers - you may want to check them out

The reason it does that is because the Issued to CN (Common Name) does
not match the domain name you are visiting when you access their site. 
If you select "View Certificate", you'll see that it is in fact signed
by Verisign.

They could fix it by adding their "pcbanking.washingtonmutual.com" to
one of the standard X.509 version 3 extension fields:

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212201513380.14927-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  My copy of VMware is used for the GPS software and an old version of
mapping software; I don't think that I ever configured any communications
application within the guest OS: win98se.

  The latest version of the GPS software will automatically seek the nearest
Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) to where data are collected
and correct the raw data to remove the inherent inaccuracies. But, I don't
know what I might need to do to let the virtual OS access the 'Net. As
little as I know about linux, I know less about Windows.

  Do I need to do anything in particular to let the application access the
'Net? I use samba to share data between the virtual machine and the linux
host.

Thanks,

Rich

According to RH, there is supposed to be a menu option (START menu) in
System Settings called Printer System Switcher which switches from LPRng
to Cups. I don't have this. How do I get it or accomplish the same thing
without it?

looks like printconf-gui is for lpr
try /usr/bin/cupsconfig

Don't seem to have a tool for switching between the two (RH7.3), but both of 
those apps are in my gnome menu (Programs | System)

When launching the CUPs tool, I get this:

	CUPS must be running in order to use this configuration tool.
	Please start CUPS by running
		"/sbin/service cups start"
	as root.

	If you are currently running a different print server (such as 		
	LPRng), you may have to turn it off before CUPS can be started, e.g.
	by running
		"/sbin/service lpd stop"
	as root.

	To switch print systems permanently, use
		"/usr/sbin/alternatives --config print"

So there's some clues.  Also, type
	#apropos cups

Dirk,

  I thought that xinetd should not be running unless you're running a Web or
ftp server on your machine. If you stop xinetd can you print with CUPS?

I've just installed Mandrake 9...

Something strange that i've noticed is that every other time I boot up
this machine the mouse doesn't work - it apparently conflicts with the
modem.  I'm using a PCI modem and mouse plugged into the aux port.

The following link was made for /dev/modem:
/dev/modem -> /dev/tts/4

What the heck is /dev/tts/4 (does it mean serial port 4)?  I'm used to the
serial devices being named something like: /dev/ttyS0 (I guess I'm behind
the times :)

/proc/pci lists the following for the modem (this is the bootup where the
mouse works, though):
  Bus  0, device  11, function  0:
    Serial controller: US Robotics/3Com 56K FaxModem Model 5610 (rev 1).
      IRQ 5.
      I/O at 0xd000 [0xd007].

I also notice that looking into /proc/interrupt that the mouse has
interrupt 12, though I'm not too sure what ioport addresses it's on.

It would seem that perhaps  the pnp bios is assigning IRQs
or I/O ports differently on differently each time it boots (?)

I also notice that when it boots up with the mouse not working that there
is no psaux device in the /dev/misc directory, but it is there the next
time I reboot (and as I said, it toggles, one time it will be there but on
the next boot it won't be - it's very consistent).

Message-ID: <1040482901.1378.8.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I am installing RedHat 7.3 on one of my dad's computers.  This has been
the most challenging install I've performed of this OS.  The first time
through the computer would not boot, freezing about half way through the
OS boot process. 

The second time I installed, I was able to boot the computer using a
floppy disk and was able to run up2date but that froze sometime during
the process.  I left the computer on for about 12 hours before I

Microsoft is Coming To Town (To the tune of Santa Claus is Coming To Town)


You better watch out
You better not cry,
"I don't know where all my licenses lie!"
Microsoft is coming to town
You paid for it list,
You paid for it twice;
You paid even more for legal advice.
Microsoft is coming to town
They know when you run Windows
They know when you use Word
They treat a loyal customer
Like a lying, thieving turd.
With auditing threats
In letters that come
Their lawyers will have you reaching for Tums
Microsoft is coming to town
Bill's desperate now
There's no time to play
He's casting dot-Net to drag in your pay
Microsoft is coming to town
They offer a solution
When you are left in tears
Just sign here on the bottom line
And subscribe for fifty years!
Oh, you should have watched out
Gave Linux a try
Now licensing six is bleeding you dry
Microsoft is coming to town
Microsoft is coming to town!

Robert,

I had problems when I first installed Red Hat 8.  Do you have at least
64 MB RAM for a text install?  I believe that you need 128 MB for a
graphical install.  What is the hardware configuration for this pc?

TIA,

Jim

I hate to butt in here, but are you freaking kidding me?

Does Red Hat actually give requirements like that?

I've performed Debian installs on machines with 8MB RAM without a hitch.

Are other commercial distributions this hoggish (assuming that the above
requirements exist in addition to the enormous hard disk requirements of
Red Hat)?

I've never had trouble using the graphical installer on a machine with
64 megs of RAM.  The PC I'm having trouble with has 256 and is a PII450,
ATI Rage Pro graphics card, two intel EterhNet Pro devices, a MS usb
optical mouse with a USB to PS/2 adapter, a scsi adapter pci card, and
that is essentially it.  I get all sorts of weird I/O and kernel errors
when I boot this last install, but I'm able to do an up2date on the
system.  Same as before. Let's see what happens after I reboot.

Rebooted same thing lots of kernel errors and now that I see it again,
I'm reminded that I'm also seeing a lot of segmentation faults.  I'm at
a loss this time.  

Kind of embarrassing really.  I'm setting this system up for my dad, who
is a huge Windows user (about 10 computers at his house with Windows)
and I've been telling him how great Linux is so he was willing to try a
computer with this OS.  :)  Oh well.  I'll keep trying.  Any suggestions
out there would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: [PLUG] Can't access CDROM
Message-ID: <20021221170232.D8BB22FEA6@joseph.doink.com>

I've been playing around with backup/recovery software on a spare 
computer.  My last test, like all but one previous test, was a 
failure.  So, I popped in my Mandrake auto-install floppy and the 
Mandrake CD.  The auto-install program can't access the CDROM 
anymore.  I tweaked my BIOS to boot from CDROM before floppy and put 
in a boot CD.  Neither my Mandrake boot CD nor my Redhat boot CD are 
recognized as boot media.

Any ideas how I can get my CDROM working again?  I won't be able to 
recover this machine without it.

Thanks....

I'd like to second the advice to use memtest86. I had the same
situation, segfaults, file read errors, etc. memtest86 came back with
lots of failures and memory shop on Macadam found one of my mem sticks
was bad. It's easy to download, build and use.

I haven't seen xinetd used as an lpr launcher before...

You'll want to poke around /etc/xinetd.conf and /etc/xinetd.d/* and 
look for something that looks as if it launches lpr or cups.

According to RH up2date, a kernel rpm built for the athlon (this machine
is actually a Duron) is available. Will I get much of a performance gain
by installing it and are there any gotchas I should know about?

You're right about  lpr, but xinetd does launch cups-lpd if you tell it
to by setting disable=no. lpd is launched by default during boot, but
this can be changed by running "redhat-switch-printer" which makes all
the changes to the alternatives system so that cups is started and so
that lpr, lpq etc work.

Thanks for the suggestions.  I'm in fact installing on an IDE CD-ROM. 
The SCSI adapter card is empty (no devices connected).  I don't have
other distros to test out.  I was able to successfully (so far) install
it on another computer, so I'll stick with that and chalk up the
previous failure to bad hardware.

  To save me from subscribing to the OO users list I'll ask this question
here 'cause I know there are other OpenOffice users on the list.

  How do I indent a paragraph one tab stop from the left margin? I would
like to do this both with a complete paragraph and with a paragraph that has
text against the left margin with multiline text one tab stop to the right.

  In WordPerfect this was done by pressing the Indent key rather than the
Tab key, but I've not yet discovered how this is done in OO other than
manually tabbing the left end of each row.

Thanks,

Rich

I second or third the bad memory proposal. I had an installation 
problem very similar to yours with an AMD k6-2 based machine.
I took out one of the  memory simms and the problem cleared up.
Seems the linux kernel pushes the hardware a little more than
windows and these hardware problems show up.

bios and this cleared the problem up

You can install Slackware on a system with 5MB of RAM... less if you
really know what you're doing (get away w/o an initrd).

It wouldn't be pretty.... but you could do it.  :-)

Yes you'll get a little boost in performance - but the kernel is really
only one small part of performance... optimizing the big apps on the
system causes a greater increase in speed.

Gotchas:

RH Compiled the kernel likely with a bajillion wierd patches.  I like
compiling my own kernel - I know exactly what is in it, what is enabled,
and nothing I don't want is there, eating up a few KB of RAM.

The kernel would likely be compiled with GCC 3.x in order to get any
real Athlon optimizations.  I haven't had any problems with GCC 3.2
compiling kernels... but some have.

Look under Format --> Paragraph.  You can set up both the first line
indent and the paragraph indent.

I haven't been able to get printing out of any version
of RH since 7,0. That's why I don't use it. I've had
no trouble in this respect with Caldera or Mandrake.

Now that RH has a 50% market share among Linux users,
though, I suppose I should give it another try, by
downloading 8.0 and following this discussion on the list.

Robert,

  Right after I sent the message I remembered that I hadn't mentioned that
the above doesn't work -- for me, at least.

  If I set the paragraph indent at 1" with the first line remaining at 0",
the entire paragraph -- including the first line -- is moved over. I have
tried this several times with the same results. Perhaps I do need to report
this as a possible bug.

Thanks,

Rich

On the main page you will find links to subscribe as consultant and/or agent.

Free Software Consortium is a multinational consortium established to link the
companies and the independent consultants that use and promote free software.

One of the bigger obstacles to the development of the free software services
market is the fear of many companies to establish contracts with independent
consultants who do not have support of a well known Company, Corporation or
Consortium.  Questioning quality, support, experience and capability to
successfully complete a project are the companies manager's main concerns when
considering the option of migrating their systems to free software.

Like you, we know the excellent quality that Free Software offers.
We have complete confidence that Free Software is going to be the platform of
the future. That is why it's so important to work and consolidate together to
solve the problem mentioned above.

Free Software Consortium intends to fill this void joining the best free
software companies and consultants at the national and international level.

By joining to Free Software Consortium you or your company will have the
following benefits:

1. Possibility of being hired by other Consortium members.
2. Possibility of hiring other Consortium members.
3. Use of the Consortium image and name with your clients.
4. Use of the Consortium's resources like Publicity Brochures, Business Cards,
Banners for presentations and events, financial presentations, publicity
articles for the press and magazines, support via mailing list and forums with
the Consortium's members, marketing and communication assistance, CD's and
manuals from the Consortium, site and mail hosting (yourarea.fsc.cc) and other
future services.
5. Representation of the FS Consortium in your area to share administrative,
legal and marketing resources between the Consultant members in your area.

Free Software Consortium will establish a contract with an Agent company which
will have exclusive representation in it's area, in charge of organizing the
consultants in the area.  This Agent company will provide the administrative
services, marketing and sales with the local customers.

>From the business generated by the Free Software Consortium, the Agent company
will receive 20% of the value of the contract, and the Consultant or 
Consulting
company will receive 80%.

The Free Software Consortium is developing a new business model and invites

I figured it out.  My reasoning is that if the restore left my IDE 
drive in a weird state, and the CDROM is on the same IDE bus, then 
fixing the state of the hard disk could allow the CDROM to work.  I 
booted tomsrtbt from floppy, ran 'mke2fs -j' and 'mkswap' for all my 
hard drive partitions, ejected and reloaded a CD, and mounted a CD 
while still running tomsrtbt.  All was well at that point.  Now the 
CDROM drive can be accessed by other boot sequences as well.

TTFN....

All,

Some of you remember the days when we could set the Ethernet device's
EEPROM flags with a DOS-based utility. Well, here's a collection of
Ethernet device utilities for Linux:

  http://www.scyld.com/diag/index.html#mii-diag

I greatly improved network transfer speed on the internal subnet hosts
by using the mii-diag utility to set the devices to full-duplex. A side
benefit of this is that my NFS clients are more responsive during heavy
load as they are not working so hard on the Ethernet transfer.

Note that mii-diag worked on both the Tulip and the RealTek without
modification. Several other models are supported.

Looks like spam to me.

Isn't 20% a bit high, regardless?  I mean, geeze, I think most agents
who go out hunting for work for you get 10%.  These guys just provide a
means to contact people who might give you work.

I'm trying to install XINE for DVD playback.  I have compiled/installed 
xine-lib and dependencies without problem, but now I cannot compile the

I'm just flying off the cuff after a long night out, but I think I got you
covered.  I made a lot of assumptions, but nothing too weird, I think.

OK...

This is saying that /usr/local/include is already included as a system
directory, but by explicitly stating it, you're putting it at the end of
the search instead of at the beginning with the other system include
directories.  This is basically just a search-order thing says to use the
explicitly denoted directories first in the case of a name conflict, but
also effects how the include files are referenced in the source.

That's your real error right there.

to there is all just errors resulting from trying to use data from headers
that weren't included.

And that all means that it's dumping out of the compile process and
putting you back where you were.

Seems to me like your X11 headers aren't where your system wants them to
be or are referenced in such a way in the source as to not be
found.

Where are your X11 headers?  (Try `locate Xos.h`)

If they're in /usr/local/include/X11, then you might want to remove the
-I/usr/local/include from the Makefiles (or wipe the directory, dump out
the tarball again and run the confugure without explicitly including
/usr/local/include).  This leaves /usr/local/include in its proper
position in the search path.

If they're somewhere else, make sure the somewhere else is either a system
include or explicitly defined in that massive gcc command.  You may have
to use a --with-x= flag on your configure script.

If they're not on your system at all, then you either don't have X or
didn't compile it yourself.  If that's the case, then get the X11
development package for that distribution and insall it.

  Over the past month or two we've read too many threads that degenerated
into rants about capitalism, corporations and other socioeconomic concerns
that have nothing to do with the computer OS we all prefer. So, aligned with
the warm, fuzzy, soft-and-squishy feelings that advertisers sell us as the
ideal for this season of Winter Solstice, I want to make Those Who Care
About Such Things aware of a highly informative, educational and encouraging
two-page article in The Economist's December 14th issue.

  On pages 62-63 is a Special Report on corporate social responsibility.
History shows us that the Anglo-Saxon corporation is far from heartless,
that too many folks confuse the capital finance markets with corporations,
and that simplistic, one-size-fits-all attitudes are easily refuted.

  Read it, please. I removed those two pages before tossing the magazine in
the recycling can so if anyone wants this (particularly you educators on the
list), I'll mail it to the first requestor.

Cheers!

Subject: [PLUG] Getting MySQL running
Message-ID: <3E0659A9.AD5B407F@attbi.com>

I reloaded RH 7.0 on my 200 MHz Pentium machine, and am attempting to
remember how I got MySQL running. I'm following directions from a couple
of books that tell me to run the following:

mysql_install_db
safe_mysqld --user=mysql &

The first command seems to have worked; at least there weren't any error
messages. The second command starts, and then stops. Here's what I get:

--------------------------
[root at nec bin]# safe_mysqld --user=mysql &
[1] 26422
[root at nec bin]# Starting mysqld daemon with databases from
/var/lib/mysql
021222 16:26:11  mysqld ended     
--------------------------

>From this I conclude that mysqld is not running, and indeed, I do not
find it in a ps ax list.

I assume that I've left out something important. Any assistance will be
greatly appreciated.

Look in /var/lib/mysql/$(hostname).err. There are many possible 
causes, a couple of which are

1. The 'mysql' user doesn't have r/w privs to /var/lib/mysql or the 
   files in /var/lib/mysql/mysql. A simple chown will fix you up.

2. You're using the innodb table format (*.MYI) but haven't added the
   requisite innodb_* settings into my.cnf. See the InnoDB stuff in 
   the online MySQL manual for a generic set of settings.

3. It's linked to a library it can't find. Run ldd against the mysqld 
   binary to find out.

Message-ID: <1040620805.1443.2.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I have a webserver that has an onboard nic (eth0) and a pci nic (eth1). 
I disabled eth0 in bios because the NIC would not work with Red Hat
7.3.  When I booted the computer, both nics were discovered by Red Hat,
with eth0 active and eth1 inactive.  I was unable to pass any traffic on
eth0 (obviously), so I removed it and activated eth1.  I actually
removed eth0 because on every boot, eth0 would be activated and eth1
would be inactivated.  Now, I have only the one NIC and whenever I boot,
eth1 is inactive.  What do I need to do to make eth1 activate on boot? 
I tried giving it an alias of eth0, but that didn't work.

Subject: [PLUG] Playing an avi file? (Trying to RTFM)
Message-ID: <20021223052422.D2AD73498B@ados.com>

Okay. 

I am a Linux 'user.'

I am running KDE 2.2.1 in Mandrake 8.1.
I have XMMS installed, and want to play AVIs.

I don't want to use MPlayer, because the MPlayer page mentions some kind of 
security vulnerability ( I got fried here the last I brought this up, but the 
jyst is that the vocabulary which describes said vulnerability is WAY over my 
head.) Discretion being the better part of valor, I decided to look for other 
alternatives to Mplayer, especially ones WITHOUT mention of security 
vulnerabilities, 'known bugs' or hellaciously complex installs.

Over the past several weeks, I have spent short packets of time searching for 
files named "[This-plays-AVI's].i386.rpm" but haven't found anything useful.
Meanwhile, no AVI's for me.

So I am biting the bullet and trying to go to the next level and looking into 
.tar.gz's. (Ugh.) One of these which looked promising is:

http://freshmeat.net/redir/avi-xmms/545/url_tgz/avi-xmms-1.2.3.tar.gz

so I nabbed that. Upon unpacking it, the 'README' file contains the following:

"This plugin uses the aviplay library version 0.53.5. Avifile is included
in the archive and will compile to a static library and then static linked
into the plugin. This means there will not be any other files installed
exept for the plugin itself. Please make sure you don't have avifile linked
to xmms as avi4xmms require that to function, if you do you will not be
able to play any avi files as there will be a conflict between avifile
versions."

:-) -> OK, so if XMMS was already installed when the [VERY GOOD PERSON WHO 
DESERVES A GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT AND GRATITUDE - Thanks!!!] set up my system, 
I have no idea whether "avifile" is "linked to xmms" or not. Shall I take the 
plunge, or no?

:-) -> The following seems arduous. How do I know if I'm using 
[Letters-I-never-heard-of-before] decoding, whether I have 
bunch-of-other-letters-or better .... ? And of course, the penalty for NOT 
guessing right is a crash. (Not any worse than Windoze, right?)

" Also, SDL library (www.libsdl.org) is required to play movies using 
avi-xmms. If you plan to use software YUV decoding, you should have SDL 1.1.7 
or better, because software YUV decoders of SDL 1.1.6 (and previous versions 
also) are broken and will cause XMMS to crash.'


:-)  -> Good heavens: (does this thing work, or not?)
"We have the big issue with this plugin: If SDL is compiled using Xfree 4.0
and NOT Xfree 4.0.1 it will not work in a correct way and crashes a lot.
Xfree 4.0 has a threading bug in libXv.a that SDL compiles statically and
XMMS is a threaded application and that's why this plugin won't work with
Xfree 4.0. Please upgrade Xfree to 4.0.1 Else you can compile SDL without
libXv.a but you won't get Hardware acceleration do (in SDL directory):
./configure --disable-video-x11-xv"


:-)  ->  HELP IN SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS WANTED PLEASE ....
          and feel free to e-mail me privately... (preferred.)

Thanks, Paul. That was the problem. I don't remember having to go
through this before, but it was almost a year ago, and I only had to do
it the one time.

For the benefit of the archives (so I can search for it if I ever need
it again!) here's what I started out with, what I did to change things,
and the result.

I use XINE and MPLAYER myself... ogle or vls for DVDs.

XINE was a very easy compile, IIRC.

Well, MPlayer is also not the easiest sucker to use from a UI point of
view.

'tis why I like xine.

But, to find some complex piece of software with no known bugs or
security vulnerabilities may well be impossible.  As for complex
installs... ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install usually
does the trick for me.  Xine, at the very least, had good documentation
on how to get it compiled (I think).  :-)

First of all, you control the order of what's eth0 and what's eth1, this
is done in modules.conf, like this:
alias eth0 3c509
alias eth1 off

Now PCI card (3COM in this example) will be eth0, and eth1 will be
disabled. If you give the module for eth1, they'll both be active.
As far as what's configured on boot, this is controlled by scripts in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts. You should have ifcfg-eth0, ifcfg-eth1,
etc for every interface you want to come up on boot. Each file has stuff
like IP address, netmask, etc. Pay attention to the gateway settings, only
one of your interfaces should provide the default route, so in
/etc/sysconfig/network don't forget to specify GATEWAY and GATEWAYDEV.
Look at "route -n" output, you should have exactly one default route.

MPlayer is hard to install, bu only if the RPMs from FreshRPMs.net don't
want to install on your system, or they don't have the ones you want.
I'd ignore the security vulnerability thingie, unless you're installing it
on some school system full of nosy students.
MPlayer can play just about anything you can throw at it, and most of the
time it figures out what codecs to use all by itself. On the other hand,
if you want to use its GUI, it's cumbersome, and if you need to ask a
question to developers, don't bother, here is the universal answer sheet:
1) Go RTFM (use this answer if this is the first time you ask the
question)
2) Go RTFM you asshole (use this answer second and all other times)

Subject: [PLUG] SSH Question
Message-ID: <1040627744.2930.3.camel@localhost.localdomain>

I'm trying to set up a way to connect to a server and start gnome
remotely.  I've been spending several hours on trying to figure this
out.  I've read several websites on using ssh-agent or ssh -X, etc.  The
problem is, I'm not able to see the session start on my local machine,
although I'm able to start it on the other machine.  None of the
documentation I found tells me how to start use gnome remotely while I'm
currently using gnome on my local machine.

In other words, how do I use the remote gnome session on my local
machine, while I'm using gnome on it?

Is there a way I can send the remote gnome session to another terminal
(something I've tried and been unsuccessful at)?

This reminds me of a question related to a problem I had several months
ago which was resolved without ever answering the question.  (How's that
grammar, eh?)

The question was:

How does one determine order of ethernet devices (eth0, eth1,...) when the
ethernet drivers are compiled into the kernel?

Of course, I meant that to read "How does one CONTROL the order of the
ethernet devices...".

Determining the order once the thing boots is pretty easy.

One passes parameter to the kernel at boot.
I've only done it in a PC which had two cards of the same make, the
parameter there was something like this:
ether=5,0x220,eth0 ether=3,0x280,eth1
so you tell the kernel which one is eth0 and which is eth1 by IRQ, not by
card model (I don't know if you can tie eth0 to the card model or not,
does not seem to be any place for it in the syntax of ether option).
The simplest way to find the IRQ and IO address is to boot the kernel
without thethe parameters, run ifconfig and see what you have there, it's
under Interrupt: and Base address:.
Of course if cards get moved around (or on PCI bus IRQs get reassigned)
you're kind of screwed, so I suggest keeping an entry in lilo to boot the
kernel without these options (just in case probing the old IRQ under new
configuration hangs the kernel). With GRUB it's less of a problem because
you can edit its bool lines duiring boot.

I'm a bit unclear as to what you want to do:

1. Run a single GNOME app on <remotehost> and have it display itself 
   on <localhost>?

2. Run a full GNOME desktop, window manager included, on <remotehost> 
   and have it display itself on <localhost>?

If you're looking for #1, please post to the list the shell commands 
you've been using to launch the remote application. We'll help you 
decipher the output and/or error messages.

If you're looking for #2, then ssh by itself isn't the tool you need. 
If <remotehost> is not on your local, trusted LAN, you'll want to look 
a VNC or TightVNC. If it is on your LAN, and you've got some bandwidth 
to spare, then you can use X directly.

Either way, let us know.

Rich,

I was able to get this working via the following:

Menu:	Format -> Paragraph
Tab :	Indents & Spacing
Section:Indent
	From left: set to desired numbering
	First line:set to -1 * From left

It would appear that the first line is relative to the paragraph,
rather than the page.

It's just bad documentation.  I've been trying for 3 months to figure
out how to get access to the source code for the documentation so that
I can start sending patches, but the OOo website isn't much help (the
Documentation project is only for 3rd party docs) and email directly to
the developer group for the tool I was frustrated with (the
presentation tool) was never answered.

Any ideas on this front?

Colin

Colin,

  Now that you point this out I can see that it does make sense this way,
too. Didn't occur to me to try that because all the text processors I've
used tend to be measured from the margin. I suppose the changing reference
line is a winWord thingie and so is completely foreign to me.

  I'll try it the next time I need a hanging paragraph.

Many thanks!

Subject: [PLUG] Libranet fun for the holidays
Message-ID: <200212231102.14066.pluglist@bratgrrl.com>

Here's a quick Libranet report, for anyone who's been thinking of giving it a 
try. Libranet is a user-friendly Debian distribution; under the hood, it's 
good ole Debian 3.0, Woody. It's a great desktop Linux, everything pretty 
much just works: CD burners, multimedia, all the usual huge glop of 
productivity apps. 3d hardware acceleration is still a pain, nVidia drivers 
are the biggest pain of all. 

It recognized my Wacom tablet and Epson scanner with no problem, had no 
trouble with onboard sound.

The default WM is IceWM. On my old Celeron 333, it's peppier than anything 
else I've had on it. There is no custom install, there are only package 
groups to select, not individual packages. There is a base install option, 
then add individual packages later.

2.0 is available for free, 2.7 costs $59.95. Not much in the way of 
documentation, just use Debian docs I guess. For me it's worth the money to 
get up and running quickly, with a minimum of hassle. IceWM, for example, can 
be a real chore to customize and configure; having it install in a usable 
configuration is a nice time-saver. Installation itself is fast n easy, none 
of the famous Debian pain and agony. Stable as all heck, I've been pounding 
on it since the first of the month on two desktops and one laptop, no 
stability issues at all. As near as I can tell, it's Debian with a good 
installation and nice useful desktop stuff added, without gumming up the 
underlying system with all kinds of crazy stuff, the way the other major 
distros like to do.

Message-ID: <104067681201@leo.hosting4u.net>

I'm trying to run a full ssh gnome session from my local machine.  I'm able to ssh in using the command ssh-agent gnome-session 192.168.1.150.  After logging in, I get an error, something to the affect "You are already running gnome on 192.168.1.101:0."  The question I have is how do I run this remote gnome session on 192.168.1.101:1?  I was able to do it locally, running two gnome sessions, one under F7 and one under F8 (sorry, I don't know the correct terminology, just that I get to my gnome session by pressing F7 and get to other screens by using the other function keys).  I do no know what I need to add to the gnome-agent command parameters to get the remote gnome session to start under F8.

Any suggestions?

a VNC or TightVNC. If it is on your LAN, and you've got some bandwidth 
to spare, then you can use X directly.

Either way, let us know.

How about `DISPLAY=192.168.1.101:1 ssh-agent gnome-session 192.168.1.150`?

Also have a look at http://SAL.KachinaTech.COM which list tons of 
stuff.  There is an open source version of Verilog too.  It was

This looks like a case (and I'm far from an expert) of not issuing

	$xhost +

from the machine you want to connect to.

To answer your second question, yes, well maybe.  I've used vnc to connect 
to my X server from a winme laptop.  But X was already running and I used 
IceWM over the link instead of Sawfish (which is what is running on the 
workstation).

I believe that the vnc-server daemon will startx, but I'm not sure.  Try.

This looks like you don't have an X server on 192.168.1.101:1 or the user 
running the process doesn't have permission to address that X server.

While I'm the last person to knock somebody for doing something "just
because they can", I'm curious what you're desired effect is, here.

Why can't you simply run individual applications on the remote
machine?  What's the purpose of a remote session manager?

The purpose running a full session is being able to access any
configuration tool that I need.  How would I go about running just the
needed configuration tools (primarily up2date and probably some gui
based configuration programs for some other services)?

Actually, that was easier than I thought.  I'll stick with Jeme's
suggestion and start the programs individually.

Just in case any one doesn't know, I connected using ssh -X
username at 192.168.1.150.

Thanks for the suggestions.  I guess I was just trying to make it more
complicated than it needed to be.

You probably don't need to run a full gnome session on the remote
machine.  Set up your SSH so that X forwarding is on.  (RTFM; breifly,
use the -X switch when you connect, provided it's allowed server side.) 
Then, after you ssh over, you should be able to just start X programs,
and have them connect transparently across the ssh tunnel to the X
server in front of you.  If you turn on compression in the ssh, you'll
get better performance across low bandwidth connections.

If you really do want to run an entire session that way, you can try
using "Xnest" - again, RTFM - and an XDMCP capable display manager
running on the other end.  If you need that to happen across a secure
connection, then learn how to forward ports through your SSH tunnel. 
It's all in the SSH manual, but you'll have to put the peices together
yourself.  I think it can be done, but I've never tried it. 
Alternatively, you could run the Xnest at that end, with "-query
localhost" there.  I don't know how well that works.  That will
certainly work over a default SSH with -X enabled.

I was able to do it locally, running two gnome sessions, one under F7 and one under F8 (sorry, I don't know the correct terminology, just that I get to my gnome session by pressing F7 and get to other screens by using the other function keys).  I do no know what I need to add to the gnome-agent command parameters to get the remote gnome session to start under F8.

Yep.

I'm assuming you're using some sort of key system for ssh authentication
that doesn't require you to intervene at all.

Well, either way, this'll work.

Start your SSH session in an xterm in Display :1.

When you start that second X session which will be running things on the
other machine, use a special .xinitrc that either ssh's in to the other
system like so:

ssh -X -C 192.168.1.150 /opt/gnome/bin/gnome-session

(assuming there you have passphrase-less key authentication set up)

or starts an xterm from where you can run ssh yourself (and be there to
type in your passphrase).

I hope you're getting what I'm saying - if you want to run gnome in the
second X server, run SSH from a terminal on that second server.

Then all will work well.

I, personally, use TightVNC for remote access of systems... it's
definitely a bit quicker than actual X over lower-end connections
(10BaseT and down) but for faster connections (100Mbps type stuff) I
find running X apps over an ssh tunnel is faster.  YMMV.

Log into the remote machine, with "ssh -X".

Run "xauth list" and "echo $DISPLAY".

Get the magic cookie for your DISPLAY, and run:

xauth add localhost:N MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE ...

... replacing N with an arbitrary display number for the Xnest's
display, and the ... with the cookie listed previously.

Run:

Xnest :N -cookie ... >/dev/null 2>&1 </dev/null &

... and wait for it to appear.

Now you can connect to it like:

xterm -display localhost:N

You could run an entire Gnome session on it if you wanted to.  If that
remote host is running GDM, KDM, or XDM, you could probably run:

Xnest :N -query locahost

... and not need the Xauth magic and the -cookie argument to Xnest.

No, but we'd run a lot of other stuff on it, like the PLUG web server,
and the mailing lists.  If we wanted to run a lot of DNS domains, I
think it would want a faster CPU and more RAM.

I'm following the instructions on setting up front page extensions, yet
am running into a problem.  I figured it would be safer to patch the
server for the extensions instead of having the stall script do it. 
Following the instructions, I type:

patch ?p0 <fp-patch-apache_1.3.19

I then get the following error:

./mod_frontpage.c.rej
can't find file to patch at input line 872
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
The text leading up to this was:

|+++ ./src/include/httpd.h	Mon Feb 26 07:21:15 2001
--------------------------
File to patch: 

This is not in the instructions on installing front page extensions.

Does anyone have any suggestions.  Would using the premade install
scripts MS provides be the one to use?  I chose not to because they
apparently overwrite the existing http daemon.

I used an RPM for my install of FPSE. Does your distro support RPMs? If so, I'll 
find mine and point you to it. I chose the extensions for FP 2000. 

Do you know that there are inherit security issues with running FPSE? you can FTP 
the sites up if you don't need forms and the fancy stuff. I use SFTP for my non-
FPSE stuff.

You might also just try something like this.. one of my favorites.. 

ssh -X -C -f machine.name application

ssh -X -l root -f machine.name up2date

-C compression
-X forward X 
-l username
-f the last parameter is the application you wish to run.. 

Do not run this with & to put into the background as it will do that on
it's own.. This will send the desired application back to your local X
server through an ssh tunnel..

Subject: [PLUG] Keyboard mapping
Message-ID: <20021224074723.73503.qmail@web9602.mail.yahoo.com>

There is a non-hacky way to obtain Russian keyboard
input, as you can see: ??????

This was obtained by changing a line in
/etc/X11/XFree86Config-4 from 

Option      "XkbLayout"          "us_group3"

to

Option      "XkbLayout"          "ru"
Option      "XkbOptions"         "grp:shift_toggle"

So what's the problem? Foreigners who learn Russian as
an acquired language, me for example, are accustomed
to the qwerty keyboard, and can type more easily with
a different keyboard mapping than the one used by the
Russians. Is there an easy way to do that? For
example,  ?, the Russian symbol for F, should be on
our F key, but it's on our A key. That's the key I
pressed to obtain it after switching alphabets.

Well, since you're using patch with -p and redirecting from a file,
perhaps you could show us your current working directory?

(By the way, how was this mail sent?  Your - isn't a -.  Our encodings are
not entirely compatible here, but they are down below where you've pasted
the error output.)

Of course it's not in the instructions, it's an error!

Where is the ./src/include/httpd.h relative to your working directory?

patch expects ./src/include/httpd.h to exist.  This is a relative path
(i.e., relative to where you run the command).

You can either change the argument to -p or change your working directory
to suit that relative path.

Is that the only file modified by the patch?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212240046120.4150-100000@sco302.DavidMandel.com>

Hello,

    It will soon be a new year and I'm a bit confused about our
speaking schedule.  I gotten my books screwed up.  In any case,
let me know if you have volunteered to speak to PLUG and I haven't
scheduled you or if you haven't volunteered but would like to
volunteer to speak to PLUG.

                                                      Dave

Currently scheduled PLUG Speakers

   Doug Davis <mindglow at dsl-only.net>
        "Anatomy of a Network Attack"
        Was scheduled for Sep 5, 2002, but had a conflict.
        I believe Doug rescheduled for Jan 2003.

   Shaun Savage <savages at mozapps.org>
        A Compressed File System for Linux
        Feb 6, 2003

After that things get vague

    I have had a number of people talk to me about speaking, but
    I don't think I've actually scheduled anyone.  Please, tell me
    if I'm wrong about this.

    In addition, we have
    Omer Hickman <the_lord_of_chaos at techie.com>
        Omer has volunteered to speak using PHP and mySQL to build
        web pages.  We still need to schedule him.

    Michael Hall <mph at puddingbowl.org> formerly of LinuxToday
        I have talked to him about speaking, and I think we could
        schedule him sometime.  I just haven't done it yet.

    Dan Frye
        He has been mentioned as a potential speaker.
        I may see him next week.  If I do, I will mention this
        possibility to him.


    Neil has also been looking at people we might be able to get
    to come to Portland like Ramson Love from Caldera.  If we get
    an offer from someone like this, we may need to shift everyone's
    schedules around to make things work.

    Ok, have I missed anyone?  If so, let me know.  Speakers are always
welcome.  And next, could people let me know when they would like to
be scheduled.


                                          Sincerely,

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212240852260.10004-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

Holidaze cheers, all!

  I want to upgrade the dosemu installation on the workstations here, but
the latest is available only as a tarball. When I downloaded that and tried
running (as root), 'rpm -ta dosemu-1.1.4.tgz', these errors were generated:

error: Name field must be present in package: (main package)
error: Version field must be present in package: (main package)
error: Release field must be present in package: (main package)
error: Summary field must be present in package: (main package)
error: Group field must be present in package: (main package)
error: License field must be present in package: (main package)

  So the tarball was not built with rpm support.

  I have a vague recollection of a tool that replaces the 'make install' in
the configure, make, make install sequence and produces a tarball. But, I
don't recall the name of that tool.

  I'd appreciate a pointer or two; a google search didn't help me.

Thanks,

Rich

Take a look at Checkinstall. I use it all the time to make RPMs out of 
tarballs.

Message-ID: <104075352001@leo.hosting4u.net>

I'd love to use the rpm.  Will the FP 2000 extensions work with FrontPage XP?  I'm not sure about an security issues, although I had heard some rumour about it.  I'm setting this server up for my dad and he is absolutely dependent on FrontPage (which drives me crazy), but at least he's willing to try out Linux for his server rather than Windows.  I'll work on breaking his dependence on FrontPage at a later time.

You Wrote:
----------

I used an RPM for my install of FPSE. Does your distro support RPMs? If so, I'll 
find mine and point you to it. I chose the extensions for FP 2000. 

Do you know that there are inherit security issues with running FPSE? you can FTP 
the sites up if you don't need forms and the fancy stuff. I use SFTP for my non-
FPSE stuff.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0212241008300.32133-100000@linux.sourballs.org>

I'm building a new desktop machine soon. I pretty much know what
components I want in it.  One thing that concerns me, though, is noise
levels - I'd like the machine to be as quiet as possible.  (I've just
finished fixing up a Sparcstation2 with OpenBSD 3.2, and while it looks
spiffy holding up my monitor, it is LOUD!)

So- any recommendations for quiet fans / power supplies / drives (or ways
to muffle existing ones - I'd like to be able to leave the Sparc turned on
without getting evil looks from the spouse).

I put together a spec file for this .. but there is something wrong
during the configure process on my machine and I don't feel like
figuring it out more than I already have.. if things are kosher this
should work for you issuing the command 
rpmbuild -ba /path/to/spec/file/dosemu.spec

Tom's hardware had some reviews of power supplies with noise levels noted:
http://www4.tomshardware.com/howto/20021021/index.html

It might be worth to look around the site for other noise related searches.

Be sure to check out http://www.hardwareguys.com/, in addition to the many 
suggestions you're going to get for quiet components.  Inferior power 
supplies are one of the biggest sources of trouble in a system. PC Power & 
Cooling makes great power supplies, and they have quiet models. CPU fans are 
the other main source of noise. Here's a couple of links:

http://www.endpcnoise.com/cgi-bin/e/scan/fi
http://fredrik.hubbe.net/silence/cpu.html

I wish for a separate drive bay module, that can be parked any where 
convenient, and the main box stuffed away in a cabinet.

I've just built a new PC for myself, and it's much quieter than any PC I
had before, even though it's much more powerful. What you want is quiet
fans, which means large fans. So, first of all I recommend the Zallman CPU
cooler (you can get them at Fry's or CompUSA, they are $25 at Fry's). It's
a large copper heatsink made out of thin fins which open up to the top
like a fan. The fan is mounted on a bracket, not bolted to the heatsink,
and hovers over the CPU. It's a large 80mm fan and only rotates at 1500
rpm. Next is the power supply fan, power supplies with larger fans will be
quieter, check out supplies with horizontally mounted fan (fan mounted at
the bottom of the supply instead of the back), there's more room for a
larger fan this way. I have Antek 420W supply, and it's reasonably quiet.
Finally, I discovered that 80mm case fans are almost inaudible, because
they also rotate slowly, so I put quite a few of them, and now I'm going
to line my case on the inside with sound-insulating material they sell at
Fry's (it's probably also very heat-insulating, but with 5 case fans I
don't need heat dissipation through walls).

  Thanks for all of this, Aaron. Now I have lots to read on these cold,
winter nights when everything's shut down.

Subject: [PLUG] dosemu help needed
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212241215150.10888-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  Until I replaced /dev/hda and /dev/hdb with a new, much larger /dev/hda
last September, I had pc-dos/7 installed in the mbr of /dev/hdb. Whenever I
needed to access my DOS text-based management system, I typed 'dos -C' and
dosemu fired right up and everything worked just fine. Now dosemu won't
start because it cannot find a bootable image. I'm using the version of
dosemu that shipped with RH 7.3: 1.0.0-1.

  The docs are terribly out of date; the HOWTO was last revised in 1997 for
version 0.88 and the README files are even older (version 0.64). Anyway, I
tried to make a working /var/lib/dosemu/bootdir.first by hand but that
didn't solve the problem. Although the system files are there they're not
being loaded, apparently.

  I downloaded dosemu-1.1.4.tgz and dosemu-freedos-bin.tgz and tried
installing them in the same directory. dosemu still wouldn't fire up because
they weren't in a subdirectory under my /home directory. Of course, the
HOWTO notes that freedos is flaky and prone to easily break, taking a bunch
of stuff with it.

  Having read the HOWTO and READMEs I do not see what I've missed so I can
get this going. I use this DOS app for my reference library and it's worked
well for that (among other things) for the past 16 years so I'd like to once
again be able to fire it up. Does anyone have suggestions?

  I also tried to invoke the program via wine. I went to /usr/share/wine-c
and invoked wine with the full path to the executable: /dos7/info/is.exe.
Wine rewarded me with a non-ending string of font errors until I put it out
of my misery with ctrl-c.

  So, I'm rather stymied here and don't know where to turn to either learn
what I need to put where to get the old dosemu running again, or how to work
it all with freedos or with wine.

  Solutions, suggestions, and pointers greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich

It's actually not that bad off, by two or three years ago's standards.

Hmm, I've run into this somewhere.  I think that it is actually the ports 
that control it.  At least for ISA cards!  I had a problem with this with 
some firewalls once.  There was a discussion of this on the kernel list a 
long time ago, but I cannot seem to find it in Google right now...

<from memory>
I think the probing part is done separately from the assignment to a 
specific ethX.  Once the probes are done and the right drivers are set up, 
I believe that the kernel assigns the ethX entries based on increasing 
port number.  Again, this is for ISA. Not sure about PCI.

You'd have to look a the code or find something in a kernel book or online 
to be sure.

As mentioned earlier, I obtained the use of a
non-Latin keyboard through the inclusion of

Option      "XkbLayout"          "ru"

in the XFree86 configuration file. This gave me the
characters I wanted, but I would have preferred for
them to be arranged on different keys.

Perhaps there already is an alternative file, say
"ru-alt," that would meet my needs. The documentation
for XFree86 is so confused that I can't find out what
the legal choices are. If there were such a choice, I
would invoke it instead of "ru."

If nothing is already available for this purpose, I
would attempt to make such a file, and make it
available to the open-source community:

The "ru" designation must refer to a keyboard mapping
file stored somewhere, but once again the XFree86 docs
haven't helped me much. If I made my own file, I could
either use it to replace "ru," or (more likely) give
it another name and place it in the same directory,
also changing the XFree86 config file to refer to it.

I joined XFree86's "internationalization" mailing
list, and shall also refer the issue to them.

My keymap stuff is all in /etc/X11/xkb/keymaps

If you read Karl's post in this thread, you'll see that there was a
russian Xkb which you could use to generate an appropriate keymap for
yourself.  There are plenty of tutorials for generating keymaps online.

And while I'm sure the community appreciates the sentiment, generating
keymaps is kind of a personal thing and pretty easy to do, so perhaps
there isn't much benefit in making great attempt to disseminate such a
thing.  Perhaps a link on your personal website to the file would be used
by someone at some point.

umm.  DNS is almost completely limited by network speed, and
I feel like a 75Mhz Pentium with 32M RAM is overkill for a
dedicated DNS server for a couple thousand domains.  that's
just a guess; I'd have to check the size of data structures
in named.  but the machine you describe should be able to
handle a lot of additional DNS service without blinking.

Message-ID: <3E09F69D.84AB48A8@attbi.com>

Merry Christmas!

Today's Oregonian has an ad for a computer from Fry's for $149.99 that
comes loaded with a version of Linux. Here's the specs from the ad:

* VIA C3 Samuel GigaPro Processor (733MHz)
* 128MB SDRAM
* 30GB Hard Drive
* 52x CD-ROM DRIVE
* 10/100 Fast Ethernet adapter
* 56k Modem
* ThizLinux Operating System
* Many software applications pre-bundled
  including: Word Processor, Spreadsheet,
  HTML Editor, Graphics Editors, Web Browsers,
  e-mail client, lots of games and more.

Looks like the distro is from China:

http://www.oem2.thizlinux.com/products/products_main.php

A Google search on "VIA C3 Samuel GigaPro" turns up two entries, one of
which is a VIA forum with an entry from someone who bought a system with
this chip and ThizLinux on it and wants to know if he can put Windows 98
on it, and another to a broken link at Outpost.com, which IIRC, is Fry's
online store.

Has anyone had any experience with this chip or this distro, or are they
so new that this is the first time we've seen them?

  Mail's not posting to plug-devel so I'll ask this here.

  In a header file I have this:

   #ifndef __adb
      #define __adb
    typedef struct pADB {int unused;} ADB;	// line 610
   #endif

and gcc generates this error:

fsmsystem.h:610: two or more data types in declaration of DB'
fsmsystem.h:610: two or more data types in declaration of DB'
fsmsystem.h:610: two or more data types in declaration of DB'
fsmsystem.h:610: two or more data types in declaration of DB'

  I've tried compiling without the 'typedef' but it makes no difference. I
cannot see the two data types in this declaration. I see a struct that
contains only a single int.

  Will someone please show me what I cannot see?

Thanks,

Rich

Watercooling!

If you went with watercooling on a non-overclocked PC, you could keep
the whole beast quite cool with three fans - two 120mm's and the CPU
fan.  If you buy a nice 120mm fan, they'll be near silent (I saw 21db
fans a year or two back when I was digging in to this).  Water pumps are
generally near silent, as well... which leaves the loudest part of the
system being drives and the PSU... both of which can be quieted, too.

The PSU can be quieted down either by buying a 'silent' psu (I think
Zalman has one) or converting it to watercooling (google about - there's
an article for that one)...

The drives can be quieted down by - for the hard drive, buy one of those
drive kits that suspends the drive on rubber bands and for the CD type
drives - buy the spendy ones, they're generally quiet already (my DVD
drive is virtually silent and my CD-RW drive is just a little bit louder
than that - the Creative 52X drives you find for $40, on the other hand,
are like chain saws).

For a quiet PC, watercooling is the most effective means available...

theory 1, you're missing a terminating semicolon on the

    struct a {int a1;}
    struct b {int b1;} bvar;

theory 2, there's a #define that's doing something

Last I looked there was a Jabberd transport that IM'd people when they
got email  - but that would likely require you run jabber as your IM
client.

I haven't looked too much in to it as it looked to be a bit of a PITA to
get going, but I suppose if you could ID the person it IM'd you could
set yourself up with an ICQ transport and have it IM via that (there are
also Yahoo, MSN, AIM, and other transports available).

That said, yes, there are cli IM clients, but I don't know how you'd
implament them to IM you when you got an email.

One of the more popular is centericq but there are several others
available.  I would suggest using google and freshmeat.

  Yes, Russell, I did look at the very latest FSF manual for emacs 21.2, and
I didn't find the answer there -- on page 118, to be specific.

  I have a series of structures named, for example, PDB, RDB, VDB. I want to
add 'struct' to the references to them in function prototypes. According to
the emacs docs (ORA, info and FSF ps file), one can do either a search with
a regex search string or a search-and-replace with the exact text (case
insensitive or not at the user's option), but not a search-and-replace using
a regex such as .DB.

  Is there a way of doing this that I missed seeing in the docs?

Thanks,

Rich

  Thank you, Felix. I'll dig more thoroughly. This code apparently worked
with M$ VC++ (it's C code, not C++), but getting the errors out of the
headers is a _major_ PITA. I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the
version of gcc installed here on the RH 7.3 system: 2.96-112? Wasn't there a
broken gcc shipped with some distributions not too long ago?

  According to the FSF Web site, any compiler labeled as 'gcc-2.96' is based
on the development thread from 2000; the pre-cursor to gcc-3.x. However,
that's the version number used by Red Hat for distribution numbers 7.2 and
7.3. I do have the latest package release, -112, installed. However, I
wonder if some of my porting problems are due to this version of gcc.

  When I look at the requirements for gcc-3.2, I see some that are not on my
RH 7.3 systems. The advice I would like from you folks is what to do about
the compiler set. Do I just stick with what I have until I upgrade all
systems to RH 8.x? Has anyone moved to gcc-3.x on a RH 7.x machine; if so,
what was involved in addition to Freshening the rpm?

TIA,

Rich

as far as I remember, the problems were mostly back-end
things, like problematic optimizations.  front-end things
like C syntax haven't changed much.

I don't know if this will help, but there's an RPM on the RH disks, it seems to 
be a little different than the version from squirrelmail.

You could install a .procmailrc file that split off a copy of each
message, looked at it to grab information from it and see if it's
important enough, then called a Perl program to send the IM.  There are
Perl modules for doing that.

Jabberd is running on jabber.pdxlinux.org.  You can use that if you
don't expect to send HUGE numbers of IM's through it, otherwise, you
should run one on your mail server.

BASH?  I think you need to use C to do that, unless you use the device

I think it was.  I don't know what was the matter.  I did a runlevel
downa and up, and now it's working again.

I have the box set up so that "telinit 2" is safe to run remotely. 
Runlevel 2 is everything off except for SSHd and devfsd.  I then
manually restart devfsd, killall getty, manually restart sshd, then
telinit 4, and bring it all back online.  I do this after major
upgrades, where libc has been rebuilt.

Whatever it was is Just Working again.

Ok, thank you for that assessment.  Perhaps we should start a little
PLUG side business, to pay for colocation and hardware maintenence
costs?  (If it's enough, can I have a stipend, as the system admin?)

[ Back to the list, so others may use it also, and I don't have to
explain more than once! ]

Athlonrob and I are both using the "Gaim" multiple IM client.  It works
with AIM, ICQ, Yahoo!, MSN, IRC, Jabber, Napster, Zephyr, and Gadu-Gadu
all at once.  It's pretty decent -- I like it a lot; I just "apt-get
install" it, and it works.

It will let you sign up for a jabber account, use
"name at jabber.pdxlinux.org" to connect through there.  We are using the
main jabber directory still, since we've not spent the time to figure
out how to run our own internal one.  Anyone know how it works?  Is it
just LDAP?  If so, where do I get the schema?

  Thanks, Felix. I didn't see that in the index under "search" or
"search-and-replace". I suppose that as I use emacs more and more I'll learn
how to seek the information I need. This one I completely missed.

  The FSF Web site mentioned C working -- as far as they knew -- but C++
having different mangling in that version and problems with other things.

  I was hoping my porting problems could be ascribed to a faulty complier.
Darn! :-)

I tried this snippet of code under gcc 3.2 and I don't get any errors at 
all so it makes me wonder if there's some weird #define or something 
somewhere else. Have you tried just running the C preprocessor against 
the code and see if there is anything that looks odd in the output of 
the preprocessor?

That's been my experience: if you keep optimizations to something 
simple like -O2, then most things build OK. I've run into some subtle 
errors when using, e.g., -march=i686 with some packages.

The interaction between PHP and SquirrelMail is complex. I've 
encountered situations where the default Red Hat php.ini file would 
disallow functionality needed by SquirrelMail. In particular, you 
might want to play with the 'short_open_tag' and 'file_uploads' 
directives in /etc/php.ini.

Tony,

  No, but I will.

  There are several constructs that apparently worked under the VC++
compiler that are not acceptable to gcc. Doesn't surprise me, but it's
taking a while to discover them and fix 'em up.

  I read just recently (and I don't recall just where I read it) that if an
application to be ported to linux used the Microsoft Foundation Classes in
the original it has to be rewritten. Apparently those, too, are
non-standard. As my grandmother used to say, "So? What else is new?".

Many thanks,

Rich

I wonder if pushing the "#" over to the far left in that "#define" will
fix it?

Is this exactly as it's written in your conf file? I believe you need 
parentheses, not curly braces around (hd1,0)

also Windows need to be on the first hard drive. Either swap drive cables, or 
do this:

" If you have installed DOS (or Windows) on a non-first hard disk, you
have to use the disk swapping technique, because that OS cannot boot
from any disks but the first one. The workaround used in GRUB is the
command `map' (*note map::), like this:

     grub> map (hd0) (hd1)
     grub> map (hd1) (hd0)"

'info grub' is good and thorough, if you haven't tried it already.

  I did this with LILO, too, when I was triple-booting linux. win95 and
dos7. It works like a charm.

I have decided to do something a bit different for the next PLUG meeting.
I like to have a number of people give short reviews (say 10-15 minutes)
of different distributions.  Things like:

   Knoppix
   DemoLinux
   Smoothwall
   E-Smith
   Netmax ...
   Floppyfw
   Freesco
   Trinux
   etc
   Any distro will do as long as it is special purpose.
   No RedHat, No SuSE, No Debian, No Slackware, ...

So, let me know if you would like to present a short review of a distro.
I will try to get a projector for the meeting, but you may want to just
speak at the whiteboard as 10-15 minutes isn't very long.

Message-ID: <000701c2af04$3a3f9290$e6fcfea9@beta>

Hmmm...

Just wondering... and not sitting in front of my linux laptop...

#ifndef __adb
	#define __adb
 typedef struct pADB{int unused;} ADB; // line 610
#endif

I'm curious if the #ifndef is correctly stated...

#ifndef __adb
	{
	#define __adb
	typedef struct pADB {int unused;} ADB; // line 610
	}
#endif

The first one states that if __adb is not defined then #define it. The
next step... since #ifndef was taken care with the #define, then it
would be to typedef the struct. Then it would take care of the #endif.
Which by itself is no biggie... and the linker would have just oversaw
the minor error.

As it occurs in your program, I'm assuming that ADB is already defined.
Then #ifndef would be false... then the program would try to typedef the
struct again. Hence the error on line 610 of typedef-ing an already
existing struct.

The fixed version (I think) would do the #ifndef then if it was true; it
would do the #define and the typedef. Then it would exit at the #endif
statement. 

As it would occur in your program, I'm assuming that ADB is already
defined. Then #ifndef would be false, and the program would continue
onward. :)

If this fixes it please let me know... :) Of course if it doesn't let me
know also...

I wonder if pushing the "#" over to the far left in that "#define" will

I think and if I understand what you're trying to do.  Show me a before

Piet,

  I follow your logic and I'll check this out later today. There are quite a
few statements like this that fail.

  One difficulty I'm having is that I don't understand how the entire system
was designed and built. The code I have is the only part so far made public
and there is much that remains proprietary and unpublished. The author has
been really cooprerative and I'll contact him again after the new year
begins. Heck, I may fly to North Carolina to be mentored if I can.

  Thanks, Rod.

  In the prototype argument lists are structures such as (ADB*,PDB*). The
compiler complains of a parsing error before the '*' that disappears if I
replace the list with (struct ADB*,struct PDB*).

  Given several dozen prototypes to modify I wanted to have a
search-and-replace do the work as I pressed 'y' and 'n'. Cleaning this code
up is tedious enough as it is without manually changing dozens of arguments.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0212290938450.6916-100000@appl-ecosys.com>

  I add a bookmark to mozilla (ctrl-d, or ctrl-shift-d to put it in a
specific section) and the next time I start mozilla the bookmark's not
there. This has been happening for some time now, with both the current
1.2.x and the earlier 1.1.x releases.

  Has anyone else seen this? A google search didn't turn up anything
relevant (perhaps my search term was not sufficient). It's quite
frustrating, to write the least.

  After adding the bookmark I check to see that it's there. At the end of
the day I kill X and logout. The bookmarks gone missing the next day. I
don't know if this is a related problem, but since I upgraded to
mozilla-1.2.x it no longer automatically opens from the xfwm session manager
when X starts. It used to do so just like all the other apps but now it
won't.

  Insights, suggestions and thoughts all greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Rich

The other thing you can try is to rewrite the the statements like so and 
see if it makes any difference: 

#ifndef __adb
        #define __adb
        struct pADB {int unused;};
        typedef struct pADB ADB;
#endif

As far as I know there is nothing wrong with declaring both the struct 
and typedef in the same statement and you can probably find examples of 
this in the various C header files that exist on most Linux systems. 
The above statements compile under GCC 3.2 with no errors.

I think you want to put those map lines after the menu entry for
Windows, so that the mapping only happens when you boot IT, not when you
boot Linux.

Try "info grub" instead.

Subject: [PLUG] Font issues
Message-ID: <20021229202049.1910.qmail@web9604.mail.yahoo.com>

Recently I asked for advice about using Russian fonts
in X-Windows. I have solved this by editing the
XFree86 configuration file, although this solution
only works for Netscape. Netscape provides mail, news,
and Web services, so that's most of what I would need
to do using a non-Latin font. However, I considered it
desirable to have at least basic text-editing
capabilities, too.

I opened an xterm window with a font argument (-fn).
For some reason it's also necessary to use
$xmodmap yawerty.koi8.xmm

(I have only one regular user on my system, so quite a
few things are present in my home directory that on
many systems would be installed system-wide.) At any
rate, invoking Pico then brings up an editing window,
and Cyrillic text entered into it is displayed
properly and can be saved. I would be greatly
surprised if "lpr"  
would print such a file properly, but I think I know
where to go for help on this.

Having issued "xmodmap," if I go back to Netscape the
text doesn't look right. One can reset the X-server to
fix this, but it would be more convenient to issue a
command that simply undid the effect of xmodmap.

OpenOffice has localized versions for many languages.
The Linux version for Russian is not available for
download, so I have ordered it for $3.49. 

Vim and Emacs are supposed to be capable of
internationalization. I should know how to use these
clients better anyhow, so I'll look into this. At
present files containing non-Latin text look like a
bunch of garbage when displayed by these clients.

In a sense I have "solved" my problem, but the general
issue of installing and using fonts of various kinds
interests me.Some linguists have returned in despair
to M$ after their discouraging experiences with
non-Latin fonts in a UNIX environment.

Or if you add "typedef struct ADB ADB", perhaps?  IIRC, the "typedef"
namespace is disjoint from the "struct" namespace.  Also IIRC, gcc 3.2
set to use the newest C standard will accept the original syntax, just
as a C++ compiler would.  Am I correct in that?

"apt-cache search openoffice" shows me:

openoffice.org-l10n-ru - Russian language package for openoffice.org

... though I don't see a russian version of the "help" files here.  I
would assume that means it has not been translated yet.  I doubt they
are charging money for it.

Works for me in xemacs21-mule (Debian "testing").  I use the "M-x
dictionary" command, and have the Russian translation dictionaries
installed in my "dictd", and the entries are displayed in cyrillic when
I look up a word.  I assume that if you visit a file using "C-u C-x C-f"
and enter the appropriate coding system, that you can edit Cyrillic text
also.

  Have you tried running /usr/sbin/traceroute as a user? I've never done so
as root so I cannot comment on that, but running as a user has always worked
for me.

There are multiple ways that a traceroute can work.  Some traceroutes
use ICMP packets while others use UDP packets.  Sometimes ICMP packets
are administratively filtered.  If you want to check a particular TCP
port, you can use tcptraceroute, as in:

  $ tcptraceroute yahoo.com 80

Sometimes a regular ping or traceroute will appear to show a site is
unreachable, but that is because some router in between is dropping
ICMP.  The tcptraceroute utility can help in those cases.

Subject: [PLUG] Font issues

Recently I asked for advice about using Russian fonts
in X-Windows. I have solved this by editing the
XFree86 configuration file, although this solution
only works for Netscape. Netscape provides mail, news,
and Web services, so that's most of what I would need
to do using a non-Latin font. However, I considered it
desirable to have at least basic text-editing
capabilities, too.

I opened an xterm window with a font argument (-fn).
For some reason it's also necessary to use
$xmodmap yawerty.koi8.xmm

(I have only one regular user on my system, so quite a
few things are present in my home directory that on
many systems would be installed system-wide.) At any
rate, invoking Pico then brings up an editing window,
and Cyrillic text entered into it is displayed
properly and can be saved. I would be greatly
surprised if "lpr"  
would print such a file properly, but I think I know
where to go for help on this.

Having issued "xmodmap," if I go back to Netscape the
text doesn't look right. One can reset the X-server to
fix this, but it would be more convenient to issue a
command that simply undid the effect of xmodmap.

OpenOffice has localized versions for many languages.
The Linux version for Russian is not available for
download, so I have ordered it for $3.49. 

Vim and Emacs are supposed to be capable of
internationalization. I should know how to use these
clients better anyhow, so I'll look into this. At
present files containing non-Latin text look like a
bunch of garbage when displayed by these clients.

In a sense I have "solved" my problem, but the general
issue of installing and using fonts of various kinds
interests me.Some linguists have returned in despair
to M$ after their discouraging experiences with
non-Latin fonts in a UNIX environment.

Subject: [PLUG] mondo backup/recovery
Message-ID: <20021229215832.27E6F2FEA6@joseph.doink.com>

I've been trying to get mondo <http://www.microwerks.net/~hugo>
to work on Mandrake.  I'm on the mondo mailing list and I've
been getting help there for 2-3 months.  They clued me in to the
fact that I can't use gcc-2.95.3 to compile mondo.  Then they
suspected that my hardware was bad on my MDK 8.0 machine.  So, I
tried mondo with my spare computer and MDK 9.0 which didn't work.
Then they suspected that Mandrake must be bad (after insisting
that it works fine when they pointed to my "bad" hardware).  So,
I installed Redhat 8.0 and mondo works, meaning that it can
do the backup, write the boot floppies, and do a bare metal
recovery.  Then they suspected that glibc in Mandrake is bad.
Mandrake 8.0 uses glibc 2.2.2.  Mandrake 9.0 uses 2.2.5.  Redhat
uses 2.2.93.  So, I loaded glibc 2.3.1 on my Mandrake 9.0 system
and compiled mondo against that.  Still the bare metal restore
doesn't work.

FWIW, the mondo email list folks insist that backup/recovery
works just fine on a Mandrake 8.2 or 9.0 system when the
backup/recovery is done to/from CDROM or NFS.  I haven't tried
that, at least not yet.

Now to my question, what could be different about Redhat 8.0
and Mandrake 9.0 that would keep my SCSI tape based bare metal
restore from working on exactly the same machine?  Should I
recompile the kernel with the new glibc?

I'm at a loss here, and the mondo email list has just about given
up on me, insisting that my system must just be so oddball that
it's not worth getting it working.

Thanks for any hints.....

Sorry if this is annoying to some people... but I just want to
advertise the presence of <URL:http://www.pdxlinux.org/search.html>,
which is the project I've been working on for the last week.

So far, only the RFC search is implemented, and that is not done yet.
If you view the HTML source, you'll see that the search output is all
wrapped in "span" elements, so that I can style it, but the stylesheet
is not written yet.  If anyone would like to do that, I would
appreciate the assistance!  We can discuss it on this thread.

Perl programmers will be interested in the source code visible via
that CVS link in the top navbar.  Look in the PLUG module for the .pm
parts, and in the website one for the HTML::Mason parts.

Any good ideas?

RH7.3 starts an ipchains firewall by default from /etc/rc5.d that, if I 
remember correctly, filters ICMP. If you haven't disabled this you can do an 
ipchains -L from a root shell to see if there are any unexpected rules 
filtering traffic.

that paragraph is complete nonsense.  I don't know where to

Message-ID: <3e0faa0f.18b6.0@pcez.com>

All,

I am going to move XP over and make room for Linux on a newer Thinkpad soon
(about time!).  I continue to be a newbie, so pitfalls abound.

I've set up dual boot arrangements on an older PC w/95, but have read where
dual booting a laptop can be real quirky.

Are there distros that are better-suited for dual booting, laptops or Thinkpads
in particular?

What XP system files should be backed up first?

Should I do a "laptop" install or "custom?"

Thanks in advance for your insights...

"complete nonsense" might be a little strong for a list group but Felix is 
right when he states that the original code sample is correct. The infamous 
line 622 seems to be a symptom of a greater problem. Without the rest of this 
header, and any additional includes, troubleshooting is just speculation.

should be 

map (hd0) (hd1)
map (hd1) (hd0)
rootnoverify (hd0,0)

note that the maps occure before the booting, and secondly that
everthing is using parens and not brackets.

and if I were doing this for win98, the way I would do it is.
title=Win
map (hd0) (hd1)
map (hd1) (hd0)
root (hd0,0)
chainloader +1

and that should work

Run this code through preprocessor (gcc -E) and try to compile the output,
which will be a C file with no #defines or any other preprocessor
directives. If it does not compile and you can't figure out why, post the
lines on which you get the error. If you see why it does not compile then
try to figure out why preprocessor generated the result you got instead of
what you expected.

Can't speak to XP, but I've had no trouble installing Linux on a
Thinkpad 390X (400 MHz Celeron, 96 Mb RAM, PCMCIA ethernet card, combo
floppy/CD drive). The first one I tried was the RH 7.1 version
distributed by the K12LTSP project. I didn't try dual booting that one.
Next, I cleaned that one off, reinstalled Win98 from the IBM supplied
recovery CD, and did a network install of Debian woody. No problems to
speak of there, either as far as the installation itself went. (I had
trouble getting the ability to add filters to the GIMP, but it probably
doesn't relate to dual booting). Dual booting from Lilo worked with no
problems. Finally, I cleaned that off, reinstalled Win98 again, and
installed RH 8.0. No problems dual booting with GRUB. 

> What XP system files should be backed up first?

Can't help you with that one. I'm hoping that Win98 is the last MS OS I
have to put up with. I haven't bought a new machine with the latest
thing from Redmond installed for a few years, now.
 
> Should I do a "laptop" install or "custom?"

In each case, I selected "everything" when the time came to choose which
kind of installation. I'm using the machine as a learning experience,
mostly, although now that I have the RH version of the GIMP, I can, and
do use the LoG filter that I was able to add.

The braces instead of parens was my ignorance in trying to match the
fonts from the install. I've changed the map to precede the root,
rewritten the /grub/device.map, and replaced the braces.
Why is the hdb listed as hd0 as I understood grub to start numbering
with 0 so my hda=hd0 and hdb=hd1?
Thanks all.

You need either the driver disk for the D-Link card, or download the drivers. 
Even Win2k doesn't have a driver for it, it's always a separate install. Be 
sure to check Device Manager, if there is an entry for your card delete it 
before installing the new drivers, or windows gets confused.

     2003 PLUG Meeting - Special Purpose Distributions


I have decided to do something a bit different for the next PLUG meeting.
I like to have a number of people give short reviews (say 10-15 minutes)
of different distributions.  Things like:

   Knoppix
   DemoLinux
   Smoothwall
   E-Smith
   Netmax ...
   Floppyfw
   Freesco
   Trinux
   etc
   Any distro will do as long as it is special purpose.
   No RedHat, No SuSE, No Debian, No Slackware, ...

So, let me know if you would like to present a short review of a distro.
I will try to get a projector for the meeting, but you may want to just
speak at the whiteboard as 10-15 minutes isn't very long.


                                          Sincerely,

Hey,

I was looking for a Customer Invoicing and Tracking software, similar to
Quickbooks, but for Linux.

I would like to be able to print invoices and store customer
information, such as address, phone, e-mail etc.  

I would also like to be able to print mailing labels for multiple
customers or at least have some way to display multiple customer's
information.

Thanks

I currently have a laptop and use DHCP just about everywhere I go.  I
would like to have dhclient (debian 3.0r0) start only when a cable is
plugged into the net card, similar to win2k/xp.

Subject: [PLUG] Why is grep truncating output?
Message-ID: <200212301155.59222.scott_list@mischko.com>

I'm using RedHat Linux 7.3 with 2.4.18-3 kernel.  When I do ps -ef | grep ' ' 
(or grep for other things) it truncates the output to 80 columns (and grep 
doesn't match stuff beyond the 80th column either).

If I do set | grep ' ' the output is not truncated.

If I grep a file (grep ' ' .bash_history) I don't get truncated output.

Can someone explain what's going on and how to fix this?

Thanks!
Scott

Tell 'ps' to output wide date like so:

ps awwwx | grep whatever

'w' = wide
'ww' = wider
'www' = widest

  Perhaps it's the weather, but pine's started acting up and I'm wondering
if anyone else has seen this behavior. This is pine-4.44, btw.

  If -- and only if -- I modify setup/config to specify a news server (nntp)
so I can post a reply to a message sent to me from a newsgroup, pine sets
the folder to 'sent-mail'. When I exit from setup that's where it is. When I
move to INBOX and try to tab to another incoming mail folder, the
application's moved itself back to sent-mail and it won't budge.

  Going back to setup/config and removing the nntp server name solves the
problem -- as long as I exit pine and re-invoke it.

Any ideas?

Hello Linix folkz,
Could somebody please recommend any good
2D-3D video card or a chipset name for 
Linux with at least 64MB or 128MB RAM. 
It has to be fully supported, be easy in
installation and configuration without 
a fuzz. 
I'm building ultimate Linux 
machine for game programming and other
very heavy graphical stuff.
Any info, thoughts or suggestions are greatly
appreciated.

Thanks.
Alex

2D? Pretty much any high-end card will do, Matrox has probably the best
reputation for 2D quality, and good Linux support. 2D parts of Radeon and
NVidia cards are also well suported, and you'd need a really
good monitor to notice the difference in quality, if there is indeed any.
Also, other features like DVI, dual DVI, TV in/out, etc, may be more
important than the tiny differences in 2D quality between different
high-end cards.
For 3D, if you want the ultimate gaming machine running Linux, there is
only one option, one of NVidia's high-end cards (Geforce4 Ti 4600 is the
ultimate in both performance and price, although the next generation of
NVidia cards should be out very soon, at even more ultimate price). Ti
4400 seems like a good compromise, but stay away from all Geforce MX
cards.
You will depend on NVidia's binary drivers. That could be a problem if you
use a development kernel, or patch your kernel with some pervasive enough
patch which breaks the NVidia kernel module (which you'll need to compile
for your kernel from source they provide, unless you use unmodified RedHat
or Suse or Mandrake kernels, in which case you can also compile the
source, or use the module they compiled for you). However, if the binary
drivers work for you, then they work very well.

Subject: [PLUG] Vim/Xterm
Message-ID: <20021231001359.90020.qmail@web9603.mail.yahoo.com>

I recently commented on doing 8-bit text editing
(Cyrillic, in this case) in a Linux environment, and
have it mostly figured out. A couple of issues remain.


The award-winning Vim text editor does not display
such characters when it is started up by clicking on
the icon, but there are other ways. You can bring up a
terminal window, then bring up a second terminal
window in the desired font with the command

xterm -fn "-cronyx-courier-medium-    etc.

In this second terminal window, the command

vim filename

will open filename and display foreign characters
properly. (Printing? I use enscript for that.)

Anyhow, if you do something like this pretty often, it
might be a good idea to bring default settings closer
to the task. I am aware that .vimrc is used to set
user defaults for Vim, and it would be nice to set the
font there. But I'm having trouble finding a good
reference for .vimrc, although there are lots of
examples of other people's .vimrc's available.

Instead of, or in addition, to that, it might be nice
to change the xterm default font "permanently." Am I
on the right track? There is a configuration file of
some kind, /etc/X11/app-defaults/Xterm

This contains a stanza of the following kind:

*fontMenu*font4*Label:  Medium
!*VT100*font4:    7x13
*VT100*font4:     7x13euro

Is this the stuff that needs to be changed? Or is it
somewhere else? You can't do much without a terminal,
so I want to do it right.

This is one of the multitudinous places in which the X resourses
can be set.  I myself prefer to put them in ~/.Xdefaults.
You'll want a line like:

xterm.font: your-favorite-font
XTerm.Font: your-favorite-font

or even:

*Font: your-favorite-font

This last one is pretty pervasive, though.

There are three options here.

If you are wanting the fastest 2d performance, the Matrox cards seem to
be the best.

If you are going for blazes fast 3d, you are looking at the top end ATI
or nVIDIA card.

If you want to be able to play Unreal Tourniment 2003, then you will
want the nVIDIA.  (It uses some options in OpenGL that are not supported
by ATI yet.)

If you get nVIDIA, you will want their drivers.  (The ones included in
XFree86 work, but are fairly slow.

Having a fast video card is only one part of the equasion. If you are
wanting fast compiles, you will want to have very fast drives.
(Ultra-scsi raid or something similar.)  Also dual processors will help.
Lots of memory will also help, but unless you have a hacked kernel or
the proper patches, you will see a slow down at about 800 megs or so.
(At least according to the kernel developers I have spoken to.  I don't
have that much in a single machine.)

Linux Journal has had a couple of good articles on building "ultimate
Linux boxes".

The Gnome terminal (and the Gnome multi-terminal) both have the notion
of terminal classes.  You can set up a certain font + color
configuration, and associate that with a terminal class, and from then
on, when the terminal is set to that class, it will use those settings. 
This is not the TERM variable, it's the Gnome terminal's terminal
class.  (which may well be a function of the underlying gvt library... 
I've not checked but suspect that's the case.)

Have you looked into "divine", "switchconf", "hotplug", "discover",
"guessnet", "ifplugd", "intuitively", "laptop-net", "laptop-net-doc",
"laptop-netconf"...

I found those (again) with "apt-cache search laptop".

That looks like a good place to start to me!

Probably over-kill and a little 'interesting' to set up is SQL-Ledger 
(http://www.sql-ledger.org).  Requires several extra Perl packages, 
PostgreSQL (RDBMS), and a web server.

Since it uses a RDBMS reports like this are not too difficult but I think 
the latest version has this already or as an hack-on for now.

Since there are ODBC drivers, and friends, for PostgreSQL you can use your
favorite Office Suite (OpenOffice.org, Staroffice) to do this.  There is 
also a DataVision.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.33.0212310503050.24213-100000@main.cyber-office.net>

I'm looking at new bunch of SCSI stuff but still caught with a CD-ROM,
CD-R, and tape drive that uses non-LVD interfaces.  Currently I have two
SCSI cards installed but there have been some IRQ conflicts and issues so
I want to get down to one card.  According to Adaptec the 29160 will
maximize performance for legacy devices without affecting LVD performance.

   Anyone have experience with a situation like this and/or this card?


TIA,

I've got a 29160 at home; it's got two busses, so, yeah, you can 
isolate slower legacy devices on one without affecting the faster 
devices.

I've never benchmarked it, however...

Great!  Now I've got to get a deal.  Adaptec lists it at $329.00.  I've
found it via. pricewatch for around $180.00 but would prefer to purchase
locally (you know from people with necks to get my fingers around if there
are problems :-).  You willing to share what you paid and possibly where
you got it?  Btw, I live in Hayden, ID and work in Spokane, WA so the
deals in the Portland area cost too much for a will-call but would give me
a pretty good idea as to what I could/should pay.


Again thanks,

Well there is a North Idaho Linux Users Group (http://nilug.org) but the
membership is pretty slim right now.  The really sad part is I'm the
longest using Linux user and the only one I know of that 'works' with it
daily.  It became my desktop at home in 1994.  My present job has me stuck
behind a WinXP system and does it suck.

Would some kind Plugger please recommend vendors to build a Linux box?  This

Are there recommended vendors in the Portland area?

I presume you know about cygwin.  Not the same thing, but it does
remove some of the sting.

Now do you mean a "Linux Box" as in a PC with Linux pre-installed?  Or
just a PC with no OS on it?
I buy my hardware from NWNetcom (http://www.nwnetcom.com) but that's only
because I have a lot of friends that work there (and I do some contract
work for them).  Their stuff is pretty good and for Intel processors they
only use Retail boxed processors (3 year warranty).  They also standardize
on Seagate drives, Intel retail motherboards, etc etc.  NWNetcom will not
pre-install Linux (no matter how much I try to convince them).

Check out Pacific Solutions: http://www.pacificsolutions.com/

They feature Linux on their web site. While I haven't bought a complete
system from them, I have bought several parts, and find them to be good

Karl,

I must confess I hadn't thought about it this way but now that you
mention it I definitely don't need people viewing an accountant's data
on the client through the DHCP server!!

go to Frys to get parts... but I don't want to wait for mailorder or drive
to Wilsonville today. I need to pick up a semi-ok pci video card (just
using it for a 2nd monitor)... used or new... something < $20-25
preferred.

Know of anywhere near downtown/inner SE?

All,

I have added two new online tutorials to the MWVLUG site. They are as
follows:

"Basic Linux Operations"

  http://www.mwvlug.org/module_2/index.html

"System Management"

  http://www.mwvlug.org/module_3/index.html

You may also find links to the online tutorials in the "Features" block

Cooper,

Under the Basic Linux Operations slide 11, you discuss the sections of
the man pages.  Sections 1 - 8.  How can review the various sections to
see what material they contain?

TIA,

Jim,

Try 'xman.'

Xman is graphical user interface over the manual system. With xman you
can browse the man pages by section.

In X Windows, simply type "xman" (without the quotes) in a terminal
window.

Thanks, it opened up xman for me, but I saw the following message on my
terminal window that said "[Jim at Balrog Jim]$ xman
Warning: locale not supported by C library, locale unchanged"
What does this mean? 

Another question from the basic linux presentation, slide 2.  You
mention the virtual consoles.  I use init3 runlevel and then open
xwindows with startx.  If I use a vurtual console I'd press
Ctrl-Alt-F*.  Why would I want to use this and how would I get back to
my xwindows?

TIA,

Jim

Yeah but it would just wet my appetite . ;-)  There are plans afoot to get 
me a 'real' system.  We kind of need it for demo purposes anyway.  There 
is a pretty big investment in all things MS here but we use Linux for 
name servers and I ssh into my own system so I can get real work done.  As 
an option we could suggest Linux/OpenOffice.org and Mozilla to those on 
less capable hardware.  I had an interesting tale told to me about a 
retired couple, a garage sale 486 or Pentium computer, one book bought 
with a Linux CD and another checked out from the library.  Then with 
nothing more than these made themselves an Internet access machine for 
browsing and reading e-mail.
  Of course a dual boot could work to and leave the basic system in place
for the less sophisticated users and make me happy.

Jim,

> Warning: locale not supported by C library, locale unchanged"

Others can answer this better than I. After having studied this in the
past, the impression I took away was that it's basically a harmless
warning message that may be safely ignored.

[snip]

> If I use a vurtual console I'd press
> Ctrl-Alt-F*.  Why would I want to use this and how would I get back to
> my xwindows?

To get back to X-Windows, press Ctrl+Alt+F7 simultaneously (the seventh
virtual terminal-by convention-is the first X windows display).

You may wish to do this if you want to kill an X-Windows full screen
application that is not behaving. You may also press Ctrl-C at the first
virtual terminal to safely close X-Windows itself.

So if X gives you trouble, there's generally no need to reboot.

Also, if you administrate several machines and actually _like_ the
terminal displays, you can use it. I, for example, prefer the terminal
over X-Windows' X-terms when I am in heavy admin mode.

Other than that there's really no other reason to use the virtual
terminals, it's just handy to know they're there.

ComputerBits is a kind of local, I think they also distribute in Phoenix Az,
computer magazine. A couple of the PLUG members are or were involved with the
magazine. Its main draw for me is that most local computer vendors post a
monthly price sheet of their wares in it. I buy cheep so although I'm not
always
buying, I'm always looking for a deal. The want ads used to be a draw, but with
the down turn in the local economy, it seems most ads are put in by people
looking for work. It also seems people aren't upgrading, or maybe they're using
Ebay,  as much, so the used computer hardware ads don't seem to be as thick
with deals and exotic hardware ( MACs, that strange pretty plastic, fascinates
me). 

Most of the vendors in the last reply, advertise in ComputerBits. ComputerBits
has links and addresses to the vendors it advertises on its site. This makes it
easy to see who's where and the current prices they are charging.  On the
vendor web pages you'll usually find a price sheet that was advertised in
ComputerBits with price adjustments for fluctuations that don't follow a
monthly cycle. Memory and some
hard drives prices, seem to fluctuate daily. The vendor's web page don't
usually track these, so you never know until you hit the store what the day
will bring when buying memory.

Hi all,
A friend sent out this email to some folks and I haven't a clue as to what's
going on.  Does anyone have any idea what suggestions I could make to him?

Cheers,
Ovid

--

I'm having a problem with PINE/PICO at work that I'm not having on this
email account.  Here's the scoop.

I liked this account's .cshrc parameters, so I simply copied them over to
my work servers' home accounts (which are numerous, but only one is the
mail server.  I have found that I'm having a problem with my backspace key
on all of my work accounts (or at least the ones that support PICO).  The
difference between the cs.pdx.edu box and mail.saw.net is the OS: the
former uses SunOS 2.8 (solaris 8, whatever) and has no backspace key
issues; the latter uses FreeBSD and seems to choke on the backspace
key.  I tried mounting some tcsh IF statement:
if ($?prompt) then
        # An interactive shell -- set some stuff up
        set filec
        set history = 100
        set savehist = 100
        set mail = (/var/mail/$USER)
        if ( $?tcsh ) then
                bindkey "^W" backward-delete-word
                bindkey -k up history-search-backward
                bindkey -k down history-search-forward
        endif

...but that didn't even help.  So, of course, I've asked some other people
around, and, most people, I've learned, are not experts in low-level shit
like this.

Could anyone help me (without giving me guff about using the C
Shell: It's what I have learned on and I like it thankyouverymuch)?  God
knows I don't want to switch to elm and bash...

Thanks for your insights...

Try putting a stty command in the .cshrc file:

  Well, you could switch to bash and keep the pine. :-)

  The disclaimer: I know nothing about csh except that it's a subset of
bash. I know nothing about Solaris and FreeBSD. Anyone who uses pico as the
editor in pine deserves it. ;-)

  Now that the legal stuff is covered, see if either OS has the equivalent
of 'keymaps' (man keymaps). I use this in linux to remap the ctrl and caps
lock keys on the console (it feeds loadkeys). In X, use xmodmap.

HTH,

Rich

Short of that, GIF or JPEG, as small as you can get 'em while still
