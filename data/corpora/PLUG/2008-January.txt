I think I'm going to toy around with the Linutop. Anybody have any comments
about this system? Looks fun.

What about these:
http://www.pcengines.ch/alix3c3.htm or
http://www.wdlsystems.com/modperl/view_services.cgi?r=detail&prod_num=1EBOX48&aisle_id=1016

Although both of these you will need your own Linux distro and power supply.
The alix board will require a case.

It's a little expensive (well over $300) compared to the ones below:

http://www.pcengines.ch/alix3c3.htm or
http://www.wdlsystems.com/modperl/view_services.cgi?r=detail&prod_num=1EBOX48&aisle_id=1016

In fact, unless compact size in a unit that requires separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse is a very important issue, getting a computer on Ebay would probably be a better deal.

Hi,

I've had a fit-PC (with internal HDD & Gentoo) for about a month and 
have no complaints, $285 + 40 S&H from
http://www.fit-pc.com/new/fit-pc/about-fit-pc.html

Cheers,

The 4800 is great.  It's what Zonbu uses for their desktop.  The 4300,
due out this month, should be under $150 and powerful enough for
anything short of Flash video.  Same size as the 2300, which I love.

Via has a new Pico-ITX-based kit that looks interesting: 1 GHZ
PC-compatible, up to 1 GB DDR RAM, space for a 2.5" HDD, etc.  Tiny,
and < US$300.

Of course, miniature systems are fun and all, but unless you *really*
need to save a lot of space and power, they're not a bargain.

I wish more of these boards came with multiple ethernet ports.  They would
make great firewall/snort boxes.

Subject: [PLUG] NFS-DHCP?
Message-ID: <476138.59057.qm@web50611.mail.re2.yahoo.com>

I know next to nothing about what I am attempting to do, so I thought I'd ask for advice. I want to use a Linux computer (SuSE 10.3) as an NFS server, and it normally receives an IP address from a 2700HG-D "Internet gateway" by DHCP. When I assign a static IP to the (sole) network card on the server, it seems to have problems.

At the same time, a NFS client should have a line something like this in fstab:

<server>:/home  /mnt/home  nfs  rw  0  0

which, by its very nature, entails that <server> does not change. Anyhow, it occurred to me that if I assigned an alias to the server's network card, that address would not change between boots and could be used for this purpose (at least, on a network with no more than a few computers). It this a tenable approach?

That might work.  But better would be to just fix the network

would be to tell the DHCP server to always give out the same address
to your server.  I have no idea wthat a 2700HG-D is though, so I can't
give step-by-step instructions.

PSU has been moving PLUG from room to room lately with the
promise of giving us a more permanent location once the new
engineering building is finished.

Well, new engineering building is finished and we will have room 325
in this building starting with the Jan 4, 2008 meeting.
The building is on SW 4th across from SW College Street.

I hope to get there early enough tonight to put up a few around
Smith, so that nobody gets confused.

I will not be coming up early, so I won't be able to distribute any of
these myself.

I seem to have come down with the bad cold and can not make the meeting tonight.

Could someone volunteer to "lead" the meeting?
In other words, start things about 7:00 PM and
take a few minutes describing the organization
and discuss local events or whatever while:
    (1)  Late comers get to the meeting
    (2)  Our speaker sets up for the presentation

Then introduce tonight's speaker, Cooper Stevenson from Opensourcery,
and close by reminding people about the post meeting meeting at the Lucky Lab.

Thanks,
I will miss the beer this month.

Here are some excerpts from the BBC:

"The chip maker has been promoting its own cheap laptop, the Classmate, in 
many of the same places as the OLPC."

"He added that the use of AMD chips in the first XO laptops had not influenced 
its decision."

"Prior to Intel's involvement, OLPC founder Nicholas Negroponte criticised the 
chip firm for what he called its attempts to undermine the project's work."


I say good riddance to Intel...OLPC will be better off without them...or 
Microsoft.

It's funny how many names, and prices, this box has.  What these guys
call the "LTSP Term 1000 PXE" wdlsystems.com calls the "eBox 2300",
only these guys want 20% more for it.  There's a company out of
Thailand selling them under yet another name for even more.  Go
figure.

Subject: [PLUG] Mondo Backup
Message-ID: <20080104155150.dxbtm97go4go0ssg@xerxes.robinson-west.com>

I'm trying to use it with an onstream SC50 tape drive.  What device files do I
need to create for the tape drive and which one should mondo use?  There are
rewinding and nonrewinding device files as well as different mode  
device files.
Do I need to use a non rewinding device file?  Mondo backup wants to  
/dev/osst0.

Another problem I'm running into with mondobackup on CentOS is that it looks
like garbage in runlevel 1.  So, I've manually shut down all services  
including
syslog in runlevel 3 and ifconfig down all ethernet cards.  This doesn't shut
down cron or logrotate though.  In runlevel 3 however, the menus aren't
trashed.

They never really *were* part of the project. They build a competing
product, and the OLPC project invited them to participate. They did, but
apparently didn't get what they wanted.

Well ... OLPC can't compete with Intel and Microsoft. As you may know, I
have one of the OLPC laptops as part of the Give One Get One program
that just ended. So I'm on most of the OLPC mailing lists.

I really feel sorry for the OLPC people. First, Intel developed and
*aggressively* marketed -- *really* aggressively -- a competing product.
Then OLPC negotiated some kind of deal with them, and Intel joined in
the project. There was some engineering -- how much, I don't know -- on
an OLPC laptop with Intel chips. And now Intel pulled out of the deal.
That sucks, but then again, that's what near-monopolies do.

If you go there you will be presented with the Adobe Flash Player EULA asking you if you agree to it. Then you will be able to download whatever you like. The main file is still just a torrent.

1st, You had troubles the last time you released the iso to just a 
couple people on the list, and now you post it to digg?

2nd, the digg link takes me to an empty sf page. Is this intentional? 
Why the detour?

3rd, the download link on your site takes me to an Adobe Flash EULA?

   http://www.mindblowingidea.com/AdobeFlashEULA.html

4th, your "2nd mirror" link says it "requires" FF, and won't work in IE. 
  Well, it works in IE. Yes I'm one of those tell me what I can't do and 
I will try to do it types.

5th, the 0.1.1.1 torrent link ref's a local drive path instead of an 
actual server address people can get to, and your "FTP Download" link is 
broke, and it actually points to an http link anyway. </run-on>

5th, your video is depressing. Are you playing air-keyboard at the 
beginning? You probably shouldn't promote /your/ product by talking 
about what you were unable get other operating systems you've used to 
do. Rather, tell people what yours "can" do. I hate negative ads. And 
don't say stuff like "all it is, is PC Linux w/ a couple changes". It's 
almost as if you're talking me out of downloading it. I stopped watching 
there.

This comes across as harsh, I know. This is just what I saw getting to 
the download link though, and I could go on. You don't need some 
grandiose site with bling and all that shiz. But what you do have 
doesn't make it look like you take this seriously in the least, or that 
you are competent enough to put something complicated like an OS 
together when your web pages and links are in the shape their in. Maybe 
the OS shows a different story and your skills will blow people away. 
But no one is going to get there. Take this as constructive criticism. 
I don't know you, it's nothing personal.

Yes, but I did not realize I had to agree to an Adobe license agreement
in order to download the ISO. I just saw "Adobe" at the top of the page
and assumed I had the wrong page.

Also, now that I finally managed to download the torrent file, Ktorrent
tells me it will be 359 days before the download is complete. I'm
getting .3 KB/s from one seeder in Japan, who has only 7%.

And finally, Ktorrent tells me the size of the file is 5.87 GB. I do
have a dual layer DVD drive, but most people do not. And even though I
have a dual layer drive, I think growisofs has a maximum file size
limit of 4 GB.

I canceled the download for now. I'll try again after you resolve some
of these problems.

I'm trying to use mondo-2.04_cvs_20050503 with an onstream SC50 drive.  Aside
from taking more than a day and only storing 25 gigs at best on a 50 gig tape,
the second tape out of four isn't verifying.

There are more than just the osstx device files listed for onstream  
tape drives.
Do I need the non rewinding device files and the different mode ones?   
How do I
get the full capacity out of the tapes?  Has anyone had good luck with these
tape drives?  I'm thinking about backing up via NFS mount through mondo and
then turning around and copying the dump to tape.

Message-ID: <20080107160121.8067bd60.johnxj@comcast.net>

Since I signed up for Ubuntu Live last summer I automatically get
notifications of future Ubuntu Live events. I just got one announcing:

Ubuntu Live Conference
July 21-22, 2008
Oregon Convention Center 
Portland, Oregon
http://www.ubuntulive.com

And requesting proposals for topics. 

I ended up not going to the one last summer, as it was kind of
expensive and at the end I decided the topics were not of interest to
me (all were for developers, not users). But I understand the price was
dropped at the last minute, so maybe I'll register again this year.

Wonder if OSCON 2008 has been scheduled yet.

According to the home page for last year's OSCon, 
(http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2007/), " OSCON 2008 will happen 
July 21-25, 2008 in Portland, Oregon."

OSCon last year was probably the most insipring tech. conference i've 
ever attended (and there have been way too many), definitely the most 
diverse group of attendees.

I am running a 64-bit version of Linux, specifically SuSE 10.3. As expected, Java did not appear in Firefox, and I resolved to do something about it. The easiest way to solve it is to install the Windows version of Firefox using WINE.

This worked so well that it created another problem: now I can't seem to get back into the Linux version of Firefox, where my bookmarks are. Can anyone give me advice on this?

Yes your Linux Firefox bookmarks should be in your home dir.

But there is an easier way to do this, once which I have been doing since
running 64bit Linux (Fedora), is to use the 32bit Firefox to be able to use
all the plugins (Java, Flash, etc) that are not 64bit.  This way you don't
have to mess with wine.  I am not positive but you should be able to just
download the 32bit Firefox RPM and install it, depending on if you have the
32bit compatibility libraries installed.  Just be careful when you do YAST
updates that it updates the 32bit one and not overwriting with the 64bit one
again, you may have to do that manually.

If you want to use Firefox/Linux and have the same bookmarks, you can
export the bookmarks from the Windows version (which it creates as
an .html file), then import them into Firefox/Linux. You can also do
this with Opera, and perhaps other browsers as well.

FWIW I use 64-bit Firefox on Ubuntu Gutsy x86_64 and I have all the
plugins working just fine (Flash, Java, Acroread, etc.). It may be
easier to use 32-bit Firefox to get the plugins, but it is no longer
the only way.

John - how did you get Acroread to work in the 64-bit firefox? i 
couldn't make it happen (on Ubuntu Gutsy), and at the time (a month ago) 
there was only a 32-bit edition of Adobe Reader v8. Java and Flash 
weren't an issue, though.

Is there a plugin available to make it display the pdf in your browser tab?

That's one reason i use Adobe's product and 32-bit Firefox - the 
acroread plugin displays pdfs in the browser, which i find quite 
convenient. It's also impressively identical across platforms, thanks (i 
believe) to the fact that it's developed with Qt. Also,  in my 
experience Acroread does a cleaner job of printing than evince - at 
least acroread v.8 does, the earlier versions for Linux weren't so hot.

i'm admittedly not an open source purist - even though i've switched to 
Ubutntu for almost all my personal & development work, i use an iPod and 
thus have mp3 codecs loaded so i can use my existing music library 
rhythmbox, i dual-boot to Vista to run Quicken & TurboTax and to stay 
current with the state of pain that is Windows, etc.

If i could only get suspend & hibernate working...

Hey guys and gals. I was wondering if anybody has

*TCP/IP Network Administration*, Craig Hunt, 2002, O'Reilly

Security+ Guide to Networking Security Fundamentals, Second Edition by Mark
Ciampa

*Database Processing: Fundamentals, Design, and Implementation (10th
Edition, Kroenke)*

I need these books for school, and I don't like spending a hundred $ on a
stack of paper, unless it's a stack of 100$ bills.

I am willing to trade or buy the books off of you, or even donate my books
to somebody or to FreeGeek in exchange. I don't have many books, but some
are Linux, DHTML, Actionscript 3, PHP.

Just trying to get my ejumacation.

You should be able to run 32 bit applications on 64 bit systems by 
loading the compat libraries:

compat-libgcc-296-2.96-138.x86_64.rpm
or
compat-libgcc-34-3.4.6-4.x86_64.rpm

Fedora
yum install compat-libgcc
should get you the correct version for your installation.

For SuSE
apt-get install compat-2004 compat-sles8

The PDF Download plugin for Firefox (http://www.pdfdownload.org) will
automatically load the document in the PDF viewer of your choice.
That's what I use since PDFs break the flow of the web anyway.
There's an option to have the plugin convert the PDF to HTML, and then
you can have the document in a browser tab.  Unfortunately it has to
send the PDF to the developers' server for conversion, so you view it
as a page from their site.  If this doesn't bother you, that's one way
to do it.

I have a copy of Security+ "Guide" to Network Security Fundamentals,
Second ed that I would be more than happy to get rid of. I would be
willing to exchange this for a book on PHP or Linux Security. I already
own "Programming PHP, 2nd ed."

This seems like a great problem for the PLUG Library to solve:
(although, it seems like the list alone is doing a fair job of solving
the problem already.)

I particularly like Russell's later comment about transparency. 
There's no public interest being served when basic things like 
"coverage" aren't defined and tested in a clearly written and 
publicized manner.

Of course, some *private* interests (greed, fear of shame, desire to 
stay employed) may be at stake...

My laptop can see a MetroFi node from my desk at work.  I have never been
able to get an IP address from it or connect in any usable way.

The official story is that they use the highest power allowed, so 
they transmit farther than the typical wireless. Their solution is 
for you to to get a high power card.

Yeah, the library didn't have the titles I'm looking for but I may have some
donations. Wonder if they'd be better used in the Library or at FreeGeek?

Not sure if this is the right place, but I have a CCNA 2nd Ed. Exam
640-507 book I've never used. I think I even have the cd, but not sure
on that.  If someone wanted it.

screw metrofi and their ads and crappy coverage. i think they also forgot
about the "work" in network.

that should be their slogan "metrofi: taking the 'works' out of networks"

And if everyone does that, I think you'll find it doesn't scale.  FTTP
doesn't have interference problems.

How possible is it to set up our own neighborhood networks? You know, one
that actually works, has decent down and up speeds, no annoying ads. Seems
like it wouldn't bee too hard. Even if four houses share a connection, seems
like the coverage and speed would be greatly improved. I wouldn't mind
paying a bit for the net, just not into paying an outrageous price. If
anybody knows of an organization that does this, I'm willing to put in some
volunteer hours. Anybody with me?

Seems like a better answer would be to get a higher gain antenna...

Well, to be fair, wide-area wifi is a difficult problem.  I am less
surprised that they are failing than I am annoyed that they aren't
more honest.  Exposing their misrepresentations, somehow, is my small
way to repay rationality for everything it has given me over the
years.

Heh.  Yeah, funny you should mention that! ;-)

I have most of a block using my internet connection.  The Personal
Telco Project has about 100 nodes scattered haphazardly around town.
You just choose your ISP carefully and it is fairly easy.  We'd be
happy to help out.

Are these for PCC classes?

If so, the Sylvania library has a 9th Edition Kroenke that I borrowed for the class. Good luck getting a used Kroenke 10th Edition for under $110, its a very 
high demand book. I did not find significant difference between the 9th and 10th editions and my instructor at PCC accepted either edition for the class 
work.

Since the O'Reilly book is not a textbook you maybe able to find it in one of the local area libraries as well, especially if you have access to the Multnomah 
County Library system or just at Powells Tech

As for the Security+ text, I'd think the best bet is to search eBay or half.com. I've purchased several textbooks for classes on-line.

Thanks

   I think that there's often much more involved. When I was in Lovelock, NV
last summer the motel had wifi access but I could not get an IP address. Not
even when I sat directly under one of the access points. But, I could see
all of them. Very strange.

   Last autumn, a similar situation happened to a friend at a local
(Portland) coffee house with wifi access. I had no problems, but he did.
Yet, he visited that shop regularly and never before had the problem.

   It's radio and computers. Something's bound to go wrong.

We had the same situation last summer on one of our trips to British
Columbia looking for work.  On this particular trip, our motel of
choice in Surrey, BC had wifi, but we couldn't get an IP.  So we
talked to the front counter, they cut us a big discount for the night
and got a technician out to figure out what was wrong, then went to go
get some dinner, local transit information and get properly settled
for the week.  The next morning, I woke up, was able to connect and
get some emails out to let potential employers know I was in town and
available for a few days.  Sometimes it pays to let 'em know about the
problem, too...

I guess it's MUCH much more since I've also never been able to get 
Metrofi working, even when standing underneath one of their antennas. 
Not once.  Ever, as far as I can remember.  And I'd guess I'd remember 
it since it'd be such an unusual circumstance.

That increases their transmit power and your machine's ability to see 
the AP better. It doesn't help communication strength going *too* the 
router though.  High gain antenna's don't help much unless they are on 
both ends.

That's wrong, actually.  Antenna gain in bi-directional, it focuses
incoming and outgoing signal.  Transmit power is not bi-directional.
MetroFi's loud radios don't do a damn thing to make client radios
easier to hear (rather the reverse, by flooding the city with radio
noise).

So, if you are in a fixed-wireless (where neither end is moving)
situation, a dB of antenna gain is better than a dB of transmit power.
Amongst other things, you are generating less noise for everyone else.
If you are moving, though, too much antenna gain ends up being too
much of a pain to aim.

>>Are these for PCC classes?

Yeah, for PCC.

I actually torrented the TCP/IP networking book, but I couldn't find
torrents of the others (because they are too recent specialized probably).
Still need hard copies because they aren't so hard on the eyes. Kroenke 10th
edition IS very expensive, but I figure I'd give somebody more money than
they'd get from buy-back, and still save a few bucks. Problem with the PCC
teachers is they are really ambiguous as to what book you ACTUALLY NEED.
Sucks to spend 150$ on a book, just to have the teacher say the reading
isn't required. It makes a difference when you've got rent to pay and mommy
and daddy don't pay tuition.

Jesus, you'd think they'd open source textbooks by now, that way we'd not
only have 'real-life' scenarios in the textbooks lessons, but we'd also have
up-to-date lessons. Not trying to say that all of my textbooks have sucked
but some of them sure have.

good to know sylvania has a library copy unless in case i get desperate.

i was going to order a comcast subscription to my house, and i'd like to
share it with all my neighbors if possible. so maybe that would be a good
start for me and personaltelco. as long as i can allocate enough bandwidth
for each user (that's not ssssssllllllllloooooooowwwwwww, i don't see any
problem doing that. is Comcast evil? who isn't? do i have a choice?

i read a communication book that featured Guglielmo Marconi, talked about
how he was sending messages across bodies of water in late 1800's, so it's a
serious question for me why we have such a small radius to work with. seemed
like him, Tesla, amongst others, were pretty optimistic about being able to
supply the world with wireless telegraphy. now it just seems like everybody
is out to make a buck selling little piece of shit routers with measly
radii. hahahaha.

not very educated on wireless but isn't the restricted radius of an AP have
to do with the higher band frequencies? if so, why not just use a lower
band? maybe this isn't the place for this discussion, but i figure it's
worth a try.

You might want to be careful with the sharing: it goes against the TOS.
"resell the Service or otherwise make available to anyone outside the
Premises the ability to use the Service (i.e. wi-fi, or other methods of
networking), in whole or in part, directly or indirectly,..."

Comcast is evil in the sense that they have terms of service that say
you should not share your connection.  There are several DSL ISPs that
are explicitly sharing friendly, e.g.:

  Stephouse Networks
  Easystreet
  Speakeasy
  Integra (if you have a business line)

There may be others (if so, please ping me privately, and I'll start
plugging you too).

I am sure that some Comcast subscribers do share their connection, but
there is always the risk that if you do that Comcast will come to you
and request that you stop sending them $56/month.  We recommend that
you send your money to bandwidth providers that are friendly and
far-sighted from the get-go.

The "radius" is a function, usually, of stuff in the way.  People have
done 2.4GHz links without amplifiers of a hundred miles or more (using
very high-gain antennas).  However, throw a few trees or stucco or
metal siding or this or that or the other thing in the way, and your
mileage may vary considerably.  Theoretically, you can overcome some
of that attenuation by transmitting at a higher power, but the FCC has
limits on the power you are allowed to transmit in the "unlicensed"
bands, so that doesn't get you very far.

You are correct that lower frequency radio waves penetrate various
materials better.  Some people still use 900 MHz for data
communications, however there are some trade-offs: a) it has less data
carrying capacity; and b) nobody's laptop comes with a 900 MHz radio
built into it.

If you are interested in wireless networks, there is a nice free book
that can give you a lot of background:

Lower bands generally have licensing requirements that the 2.4GHz
consumer device range don't.

But which has a good Mbps/$ ratio?  If you're getting fewer Mbps than
Comcast for the same or more money than Comcast, they suck

Is there any interest in getting a Safari Books Online Subscription for PLUG
members? It's $220 per year for a 10 slot bookshelf. So, that's $20/yr for
10 people. The unlimited library is $439/yr. So with 10 people, $40 is still
less than what most tech books cost. Of course the more people who go in the
less expensive for everyone. Considering I just sold about $1,000 worth of
used tech books for about $300, I don't know how many tech books I'll every
buy again...

As I mentioned before, 900MHz is also unlicensed.  You can buy miniPCI
cards for 900MHz pretty easily and run 802.11 over them (I've never
personally done it, but we were considering it once).  I seem to
recall that madwifi supported them.

That's pretty interesting...also could add a layer of obscurity if
you're trying to keep your wifi network away from people stumbling for
wifi.

I have had a number of cold calls from Comcast trying to get me to buy
service from them.  Every time I tell the sales droid exactly why I cannot
use their service.  It never seems to make its way back to corporate.  Now
that they are filtering/damaging packets, I have even less reason to use
their service. (And they have proven that they cannot be trusted.)

I need to be able to have a fixed IP, run a mail server and web server,
and be able to run encrypted traffic via SSH.  All those things Comcast
wants to charge me extra for without providing any additional service.

I have Comcast at my house and while I don't desire to run my own mail 
or web servers on my home connection so I can't speat to that I can tell 
you that Comcast doesn't interfere with SSH at all (or charge me extra 
money because I use it).  I always have at least 1 ssh connection going 
at all times, either incoming or outgoing, and have never had issues.

What MetroFi promises to do - blanket a city, outdoors and by implication
indoors, with 802.11B wireless access - is probably technically
impossible.  You would probably need as many access points as there
are light bulbs in the city now, for similar reasons. 

As far as "you can see them, but you can't connect", though, the
reasons are similar to the light bulb analogy.  You can see a street
light from a long way away, but it is a lot less likely that someone
at the street light can see *you* from a long way away.  Each Metrofi
radio is greater than 100mW (200mW? 500mW?) and only transmits into a
flattened cone of space, while typical built-in Wifi is a meager 5mW
and spews energy in all directions.  So your laptop may be effectively
invisible to any access point at an appreciable distance (say, farther
away than 10 feet, through walls, trees, or above or below the cone).
They deliver more radio power to you than you do to them.

You may have more luck with a PCMCIA wireless card (some PRISM2 cards
are 200mW), if you can find one with a proper chipset and Linux drivers. 
Or maybe not, no cards are as powerful and directed as the Metrofi
antennas.  Adding a large dish antenna to the card and pointing it at
the Metrofi antenna might be enough.  That may violate some FCC rules.

Connection is not nearly as much a problem with a typical PTP node (the 
access points are indoors in specific places, mostly, in the same room
as you are), or with a Meraki mesh (zillions of cheap access points, if
one can't see you, others probably can).  But those are limited area
coverage, hundreds of square feet rather than hundreds of square miles.

I'd be interested in participating in a group subscription to Safari.
Where does the 10 person limit come from?  Does OReilly offer a ten
person group subscription or is that the number of unique IP addresses
for a single account before their web servers shut off the service?

I did outbound ssh connections via Comcast for a couple of years and I
never had any problem with that.  Bittorrent was another story, and
that was one of the reasons I quit.

The silly thing is that they seem so worried about customers getting
the most from their bandwidth, yet they're promising 160 mbps next
year:

As someone who stumbles for wifi (ie "maps wifi networks"), I can give
a crap about anyone's individual network.  If anyone wants free
bandwidth, they only have to stumble about 50 feet before they find
it.  There are open access points virtually *everywhere*.  If you
(speaking generally) think someone is going to drive across town
because you have an open access point then you are ill-informed.
There is no need.  It is everywhere, in a city like Portland at insane
densities.  If you drive a few miles in Portland you are going to hear
thousands and thousands of networks.  I have been stumbling
intermittently for almost 2 years, mostly right here in Portland.  I
have heard as of today over 117,000 BSSID's (think wifi macaddrs).  I
estimate that at least 100 thousand of those were from here in the
Portland area.

I stumble for two reasons: a) audit networks (find specific networks
like MetroFi or Personal Telco); or b) get a sense of network density.
Well, okay, c) some of the network names show some human creativity
that are good for a chortle.  And d) if you do it from a bike it is
good exercise.

Now, if someone has a specific vendetta against you, or if you do
silly things like share windows files on your internal network that is
bridged with your wireless, then you might compensate for that
silliness by "locking down" your wireless, but I agree with Bruce
Schneier: closing your wireless network isn't polite.

There's not a 10 limit person limit. But, if you choose the bookshelf 
option for $220/yr, you only get 10 "slots" or credits for books. Most 
books only use 1 slot, but some do use more. So with that option, if you 
had more than 10 people everyone might not get equal access to the books 
they want. Because when you put a book on the shelf it takes up a 
slot(s) for a default amount of time. I think it's 30 days or so.

If you go with the unlimited library option for $439/yr then the more 
people the cheaper it is and then everyone potentially gets equal 
access. I say this because I'm not entirely sure if you can have 20 
people logged in at the same time on the same account. It wouldn't make 
good business sense for O'Reilly to allow people to do this.

I used the 10 slot bookshelf option with a total of 7 people and I 
personally never ran into any access issues.

Top-posting is the practice of replying to an email without quoting
the original for context.  This message, and your message quoted above
are formatted "properly".  You are able to see the progression of the
conversation as you read the email from the top-to-bottom.

You generally have to scan the entire email to find the relevant
portions when some one top-posts.  It's a bit like playing Jeopardy:

A: Because it makes conversations hard to follow!
Q: Why shouldn't you top post?

There are handful of other reasons -- it's just polite to make thinks
easier for everyone else, for example, but I think the disjointed
conversation flow that results from top-posting is the biggest issue.

so get a better mail client, or take the effort to work around it.  Good
communication is hard enough with out adding to the problem.

BTW you should also trim the quotes to the relevent protion.

You know, I've been reading this thread for a while now. I have Comcast
at home for basic TV and internet, but I don't know what speed I'm
actually getting. If I'm downloading a torrent then Ktorrent tells me
or, if I'm using Firefox, the download manager pops up and tells me.
And in those cases I rarely see anything over 1000, although I have
seen as high as 2300 for brief periods. I have no idea what speeds I'm
getting on stuff like loading web pages, downloading e-mail, playing
streaming radio, watching youtube, etc.

It's kind of difficult to decide I should drop Comcast in favor of
something else when I don't even know what I am currently getting. Is
there a tool I can use that will monitor my internet connection, log
the speeds over a period of time, and give me a summary like "average,"
"high" "low," and so on?

I imagine it will be a good long while before *any* email client will
know where to put your cursor when you start a reply ;)  Given the
choice between starting at the top, bottom, or some random location in
the middle, I'll choose one of the first two any time.  (I actually
have a slight preference for starting at the top, since it makes it
easier to scroll down to the place I actually want to quote.)

Hm... I wonder if a paradigm where you format the reply while reading
the email (similar to word's track-changes -- so you can see what
you've added / deleted) and then choose the recipients, would work for
people.   As long as a pristine version of the original email is kept,
and accessible, I don't see any reason to keep *any* email immutable.

   They all put the cursor at the upper left corner. The issue is that too
many folks just start typing there and don't make the effort to trim cruft,
isolate portions of the original message to which they want to respond, then
type their response beneath that quoted text.

   It's like html-formatted mail: when all your friends and colleages top
post and send html mail, why bother being different? There are no tests and
licenses required before driving on the information highway.

My ISP hosts a few test files for downloading from their servers as a 
handy real-world test. Online test tools encounter the confounding 
factor of internet traffic to the tool's host, but you can average 
results taken at different times. Take a look here:

Actually, Thunderbird puts the cursor below the original email text. 
Also, being a n00b to email lists, I wasn't aware of proper posting 
etiquette. And personally, I prefer the newest posts at the top so I 
don't have to scroll down past all of the posts I've already read. So 
honestly, it doesn't matter to me where other people post, as I have a 
scroll wheel mouse and it takes less than a second to find the latest 
post. But obviously it matters to other people and if there's a 
generally accepted way of posting then we should all do our best to 
follow suit.

The biggest problem is Outlook.  Outlook pretty much forces you to top
post.  (Unless you want to reformat all the quoted material by hand.  And
companies force you to use it because of Exchange.

Outlook is one of the many reasons I hate Microsoft.

Actually MS Lookout is worse than most, not only does it put your cursor
at the begining, but it puts your signature there too.

What you're getting is a restricted use of the internet -- crippled 
protocols and outrageous fees for simple things like static addresses that 
allow you to use the network as it was designed.  Speed is pretty much 
irrelevant at that point.

It's a bit like asking whether or not you should try to get released from 
prison based on the quality of the food.

I concur. And top-posting, when done correctly (by everyone) makes a lot 
more sense than bottom posting. It isn't reading backward, and it does 
provide reverse chronological documentation, and full documentation at 
that. Trimming is required with bottom posting :(

ntop would work for your local machine.

If you want a quick idea what sort of bandwidth your getting check out http://www.speedtest.net/

I *regularly* get 20 megabit down, 1.5 megabit up, on my residential comcast
link, out here in Aloha-land.  It's a bit slower during prime time, but not
much.

Using speedtest.net and the flash tests from dslreports.com/speedtest,
recommended by Joe and Mark respectively, it seems the fastest I am
getting is around 23,500 Kb/s down and about 2000 Kb/s up. In the real
world, however, I never see anything like that speed for downloads -
generally the best I ever see is about a tenth of that, and even that
is very unusual. I assume the bottleneck is the server I am downloading
from. And if that is the bottleneck, then getting a faster ISP would be
pointless. The only reason for switching from Comcast is because they
are nasty and dishonest. That may be reason enough, but I have to weigh
the cost, which would be substantial.

I did check out DSL about a month ago (called Spiretech, who I used for
dialup years ago) and was informed that my address qualified for the
highest speed possible (although I do not recall what it was). However,
I would have to buy telephone service (at least the basic without
voice), plus pay an ISP, and then I would still need Comcast for
television, unless I invest in Direct TV or something else. I recall
that when I did the math it would end up costing me about $80 a month,
compared to the $55 I now pay Comcast, plus having to buy a new modem
and add a phone line inside the house. That's quite a lot just to be
able to tell Comcast to stick it.

If my reasoning is faulty, I'm sure someone will correct me. :)

You can test you connection speed with this site.
http://integra.net/speedtest/

It is possible that Comcast will know that this is a connection speed test
site and do something special but I doubt it.

At last night's PTP meeting Russell mentioned that he needs to find 
things to do and there were suggestions to change "Community Wireless 
Networking" to be include more than just wireless.

In the age of co-ops, maybe it's time for the first co-op ISP right here 
in Portland. I know there's a community colocation project in San 
Francisco. http://www.sfccp.net/
Then we can tell them all to go stick it! Whos's with me?

Uhm, yeah, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to see. But, it's some web 
page all written in German. The link you posted redirects me to 
afaik.de. And although I'm 1/2 German ancestry, I'm not really able to 
translate it well enough for it to be useful...

Am I the only person on the planet that isn't having bittorrent
problems on comcast?  About the only thing they've done to me to piss
me off was kill SMTP.  Though not enough that I'm going to start
sacrificing food to pay more for shitter service on DSL just because
the user agreement is better.  That's where the assholes at the phone
company get it all wrong:  100+ years and the only thing that's
changed with the technology is the bill.

I lost count at 190 days since Qwest said my phones should be working.
 They still don't, still no dialtone.  I've stopped calling them to
get it right, I figure any reasonably intelligent person can get the
point that something's busted after the 15th time they've called from
a payphone.  I've since stopped paying them, sending the bill back
with an explaination that they can't charge me for services not
rendered.  Odds are Qwest won't get off their fat asses tomorrow to
fix it, either.  Their loss.  My Verizon experience is similar,
average wait for repair when I had them was 165 days.

You can get worse service than Comcast, but it only costs more.  I'd rather eat.

Stripped nearly completely of any and all context.

Trimming is always required.  Nobody needs the whole thread re-sent to

That's because you're expected to start at the top and edit your reply
as you go down.  It's assuming you read and write from top down, not
in random order.

True, but thankfully the number of Outlook users is decreasing roughly
as quickly as the credibility of Outlook users...

It's not exactly limited to just mailing lists.  The expectation
extends to Usenet and private email as well.  You should not expect
your audience to have necessarily received your previous message, or
may be looking back at it in an archive.

If you have to scroll to get to new material, you're including too
much text or not preserving context.  Break it up or remove
unnecessary portions before sending.

Fortunately, these companies lose credibility as their Exchange usage continues.

Lotus Notes is worse, it will not even let you move the cursor below the
top of the original message.  You have no choice but to top post.

I monitor three separate email accounts for my day job, one using Lotus Notes, one using the web version of Outlook and the third uses OpenWebMail.  OpenWebMail is by far the superior product.

Uhh...

The second co-op ISP was right here in Portland, Rain Net.  Around
1985 IIRC.  The first was "The Little Garden" in Palo Alto a few
months earlier.

We brought the first "high speed" internet into the Portland area,
through a T1 line from Mae West into Randy Bush's house, then divided
it down from there with modems.  Split it out further by various other
sites;  I fed from machines at Alan Batie's house (later to become
Aracnet).  Other secondary Rain Net sites became Pacifier, and Teleport
(bought by Earthlink).   At one point, Portland was the best connected
city on the planet (we had a few hundred active machines).  The bay
area had more, but spread among a lot larger population.  History
repeated itself with the Personal Telco Project;  Portland led the
world again ( What's next? ).

When Rain Net became too much for Randy to handle, it went
professional.  My friend Robert Chew managed it for few years, as
it grew to dozens of employees.  Then Rain Net got bought and bought
again.  I think they are currently part of Nippon Telephone, and only
handle business customers (I had a class C network, 256 routable IP
addresses, before the suits kicked me out).
 
Providers like Comcast and Qwest and Verizon are quite recent.

Most of the business ended up with corporate providers because running
an ISP is a lot of work, and the economies of scale are massive.  My
sister and her ex-husband were running LavaNet in Honolulu, and the
strain destroyed their marriage.  

History repeats itself.  Read the history of Theodore Vail and the
Bell Telephone network.  Then imagine yourself setting up an alternative
telephone network infrastructure, 100 years after 1907 when Vail started
buying up (or stealing through state legislatures) all the little
independents to build a national network.

Be very grateful that we have multiple massive networks serving most
areas of Portland.  Even if they are all Evil Corporations, at least
they are somewhat competitive and there are slightly different flavors
of vanilla.  Back before cell phones and VOIP, you used the one telephone
monopoly, with bundled long distance, or you used ham radio, or you
sent letters.  Hell, in some parts of the world, there is still only one
ISP and one phone company, and they are both owned by the post office.

It is usually new technology the opens up new communication possibilities.
ISP has already happened, and is now a commodity.  Probably the next
opportunity is mesh, or 802.11N WiMax.  But once that starts serving
a lot of people, economies of scale will kick in again, and the little
guys will be too expensive compared to the big guys.  Again.

Wow, did that bring back memories (and remind me of my age...). i 
remember working with Randy and Robert to bring some small businesses 
online during my brief sysadmin career in the early '90's. RainNet 
provided awesome service on technical and business/personal levels, as 
did good 'ol Teleport.

Since the Earthlink debacle after Teleport was sold, i've been extremely 
happy with Easystreet, but could certainly do without Qwest (who woulda 
thought that wanting to keep my old phone number when moving across town 
would result in no phone or DSL for over a month? And why can't i get 
better than ~40% of the bandiwdth i pay for?). On the other hand, i do 
grudgingly cut Qwest some slack since learning that their CEO had to 
suffer losing out on some federal gov't business by voicing his 
constitutional concerns.

Except that OE Quotefix is for Outlook Express, not Outlook 2002. (The

They just communicate with companies that have no clue as well.  These are
companies that don't deal with anyone in the technical world.  They just
talk to other "business users" who also use Outlook.  They don't know
proper quoting rules and they do not want to know.

It would be even better if I could get it to work...

Pretty much does nothing.  (It does not quite figure out where the reply
window is at.)  There is a  VB script that does the same thing.  I have not
tried it yet.

The Magic Eightball had it right.  "Outlook not good".

I'm thinking more a long the lines of an actual cooperative ISP. Member 
owned and member supported. Where people buy can buy shares, volunteer 
hours, equipment, rack space, etc. The service would be mostly for 
people. Specifically people that understand enough about larger 
providers and want better service at reasonable rates. A few great 
thinker s and spiritual leaders (Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi) suggested if 
the people aren't happy with the established social services to create 
their own alternatives...

The store at freegeek would have machines that could be used as LTSP clients.
That is how they are loaded to begin with.

Where my troubles have started.  I have a pile of 2300SX's that don't
work at all when I really needed the 2300.

WDL is back-ordered on the 2300's.

What is wrong with them.  Maybe we (PLUG member) can help you figure out how
to get them working.  (lots of details are probably needed to
troubleshoot this).

I would rather offer the PLUG community the opportunity to get paid to get them
working.  If anyone is interested contact me offline.  I have budget, and it
would really help out a local school.

The main issue is the 2nd DHCP attempt is failing.  It PXE boots off DHCP, loads
the kernel, and appears to fail around the IP-Config DHCP attempt (couldn't find
much info on the klibc ipconfig command..  ipconfig is not a typo for ifconfig).

I'm working off the 2.6.18 kernel (kernel.org) with the driver patches and
.config file provided by the manufacturer of the SoC:

http://www.dmp.com.tw/tech/Vortex86SX/

The default Edubuntu kernel for LTSP clients is 2.6.22, which I had to swap out
by chroot building a new kernel in the LTSP environment (/opt/ltsp/i386) and
ltsp-update-kernel.

On the packet level, I see DHCP Discover packets coming from the device, and the
server sending an Offer back.  These two packets loop forever, the device never
wanting to accept the Offer.

A System76 laptop (when switched back to the stock LTSP 2.6.22 kernel) boots
just fine and we get an X login window.

Um, since we've all been known to have little glitches in our thinking 
from time to time, I thought I'd just double-check something:

You're not confusing the speed test's Kb/s with your torrent client's 
report of KB/s are you?  Because that'd be just under one tenth as big in 
pure numbers without units.

Again, just checking.

I realize you probably don't have time to play and experiment, and I 
know that your switch-fu dwarfs mine, but I'm wondering...

Are these machines plugged into a switch or a hub? If the former, try 
putting a hub between the client and the switch. In some cases, I've 
seen that clear up the problem. My lingering suspicion is that the 
issue has been switch configuration, but I have no switch-fu to speak 
of, so I've always been stymied.

Also, can you assign these machines a static address? If so, do the 
network drivers work correctly?

Hmm, I've had similiar problems before and the problem ended up being 
the PXE boot rom and the Ethernet card that I was using. Which isn't 
really applicable to your scenario of it working wit the stock kernel 
but not the custom LTSP kernel you built...

I also recall there being a difference between thin clients and diskless 
workstations and that did affect how you configure things and how the 
PXE boot process works. I think...

I just checked, and you are correct. I use Ktorrent, which reports
download speeds in KB/s, not Kb/s.

Having said that, often torrents download at only 5-10 KB/s. At the
moment I am downloading Gentoo amd64 and it is averaging about 500
KB/s. But it depends on lots of other factors. Even assuming that 500
KB/s is the same as 5000 Kb/s, the tests I used (suggested by Joe and
Mark previously) ranged from 7800 to 23,500 Kb/s, so I am still limited
by something other than the maximum Comcast is giving me. In fact, it
always seems to be something other than the Comcast limit.

Hello, PLUG!

I'm pretty new to Oregon (actually down in Corvallis)
but I'm trying to help a friend with his network.  Can
anyone recommend an ISP that provides static IPs? 
Unlike my old stomping grounds, Portland (and Oregon)
has a surprising number of providers.  

Thank you!

You could take a look into DSLNorthwest. Here's a link to some reviews: 
http://www.dslreports.com/comments/1412. From a quick scan of them they 
all seemed to be positive, except of course the one from a customer in 
Corvallis...

Try comcast business services. We get 5 statics and 2 meg up /13 meg down 
speed for around $100 per month. Also I think easystreet offers static IP's.

I say go with it. I'm willing to put in time on something like that. If

I used EasyStreet as my ISP for many years - great support AND they 
don't hang up on you if you mention "linux" when you are communicating 
with their support team.  They do provide DSL static IP support through 
your phone carrier.  Seems to me that the cost was about $100/mo.  My 
phone carrier (Verizon) made me get a "business" account in order to get 
the static IP (after all, if you are not a business, why would you need 
one?)  I use dynamic DNS now, WAY cheaper.

When that was announced I cringed.  So far there hasn't been a change in
service, terms, or problem response.

Not yet: "Best Buy anticipates a closing date for the transaction in
the first quarter of its 2008 fiscal year. Following the close,
Speakeasy would operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy."

Greetings, Sue!

Besides the suggestions already mentioned, perhaps the cheapest way
to get a static IP address (and the permission to use it) is to rent
an offsite virtual machine.  My outwards facing server is a Xen
instance at the Dallas TX Rimuhosting site.  For $31/mo I get a
virtual "small machine" with two static IP addresses in a facility
with 10gbps connectivity.  They offer $20/mo plans with 1 IP and 
less memory.  I drive a virtual private network from my home network
on Comcast.

I can use dyndns.org for dynamic DNS to my comcast home network, but
there will be downtime periods when they change my IP address, and if
I am running an inbound server I am violating the contract I agreed
to.  As others note, if I run a server then Comcast wants to sell a
business-class connection for double the price.

For some interactive, large-disk-usage applications, like serving or
torrenting giant files, then I would have to back the smallish disk
space that Rimuhosting offers with extra space at this end of the
pipe, and that slows things way down.  So you may not be able to use
a virtual for some applications.

Still, virtuals get around many of the restrictions that local ISPs
may have.  Since the local ISP only "sees" my VPN uplink, and I can
(if necessary) run that to port 80 on the virtual and even use
steganography to shape it like "approved" network traffic, I can 
bypass most practical restrictions.

Torrent is as slow as the slowest machine out there acting as a server
to you.  There may be some folk with modems, and most broadband services
(cable and DSL) have much slower upload (downloading to you) then
download (uploading to you).  Adding in handshaking (to those slow
sites) and it gets even worse - you are waiting for the snail-slow 
handshake packets to leave their machines.

So you may have very fast download, from a real server on a fast link,
but unless you are communicating only with high-speed-bidirectional
peers you will see some slow behavior from torrent.  You are on Comcast,
with 6Mbit download and 384Kbit upload maximums.  On a "fair" torrent,
you will be uploading as much as you are downloading (slowing down both
directions), and you will be losing a lot of speed to handshaking and
and overhead.  So, you should expect to see a maximum of 20KByte/sec
behavior from torrent;  any more, and you are taking more than you give.

Well, you share in other ways, but bittorrent doesn't know that ... :-)

Wow.  SpiritOne/Aracnet provides a static IP standard for their DSL.
Last I looked (a while ago), their base-level DSL is like $18/month or
something.

$17.50 if you pay by the month, down to $13 for 6 months contract and
$11 for 12 months.  Haven't used rtorrent so far, but ssh seems to
work fine.  (I did ask, and they assured me they don't do any traffic
shaping/port filtering.)

If  I understand you the second time DHCP runs (from the OS after PXE
booting) it fails.

I've seen an issue like this before.  The network switch is a cisco
and does not have portfast enabled.  The issue being when the network
driver is loaded by the OS it drops the link and brings it back up
which causes the switch to attempt to rebuild the spanning tree which
can take long enough for dhcp to fail.

Yeah, it's standard with their accounts. I have a biz account with them 
and as I look on their site, I don't see those. Are they not offering 
them anymore? My account came with four static IP's.

In summary: Does 8Mbits Down translate to 8KBytes Down, or 1000KBytes Down?*

So i was on the phone with a Comcast rep today, and I asked him what my down
speed would be, since I just ordered service to be installed on Weds. He
said "8 Megs". So I asked him "8 Mega*bits*?*". *And he said "yes, 8 Mega*
bits*".

I'm not an expert, but in my head I thought that 8 Megabits = 1000KiloBytes
(since (8Mbits / 8) / 1000 = 1000). So I asked him if that meant I would
would be getting 1000KBytes down, and he said no. (I like to think of things
in Bytes not Bits. It's not like I'm going to get a new iPod and say "Dude,
check out my new 5,100,000,000 bits iPod!") He said that would mean I was
getting 8000KBytes down. I couldn't see why, so I said, "are you sure that
means I would be getting 8000KBytes down, and NOT 1000KBytes down?" and he
said yes, he was sure.

The rep then started asking me why I thought I would only be getting
1000KBytes down, "is it because you are going to share your internet with 8
other people?"

You nailed it very well Keith. Depending on how many peers you can connect
to and which machines have the pieces of the torrent you currently need.
I've had really good speeds and then see them drop to near nothing only to
pick back up minutes later after I had received whatever piece I needed that
happened to be sent to me via a slower peer. Comcast's traffic shaping (if
they are still doing it, and I have some non-scientific data from my torrent
use that suggests they are) still really sucks, but as I think has been
mentioned before, it is their network and they are allowed to do whatever
they please. I do find it odd that it doesn't appear that they are shaping
Gnutella traffic.

The other day while downloading the Gentoo DVD ISO it started out at
750-850 KB/s. By the time it ended the speed was down to 350-450 KB/s,
and Ktorrent told me the final average was about 500 KB/s. Throughout
the download time I would look at Ktorrent from time to time and the
same seeders were present all the time - that is, all seeders had 100%,
all but three were choked, and there were no leechers besides me. The
same three non-choked were always seeding me. The total speed might
drop, but the percentage of the total that each seeder gave me was
roughly constant. For example, if the total amount was 500 KB/s, one
seeder in Germany was giving me roughly 325 KB/s, one in Brazil was
giving me about 150 KB/s, and one in the US was giving me around 25
KB/s. When the total was 700 KB/s the same seeders gave me the same
ratios of the total.

I recall downloading Gutsy on the day it was released. There were
hundreds of seeders and hundreds of leechers. Yet I never saw a speed
in excess of 100 KB/s, in spite of the fact that there were dozens of
non-choked seeders with 100%, many of whom were sending me nothing. 

The problem is that there is no way for me to tell what is actually
happening. From the above it makes me want to think that Comcast senses
when I am using a torrent and "shapes" my download so I am slowly
throttled back during the download. But am I being paranoid to think
that? I don't know and, absent information from a snitch inside
Comcast, I will probably never know. Torrents work in very mysterious
ways. 

I can add that during the Gentoo ISO download I also installed a couple
dozen upgrades for my desktop computer with Download Manager, some of
which were multiple MB. Those downloaded at 500-600 KB/s and I watched
the Gentoo download speed as the upgrades downloaded. The Gentoo
download was unaffected. In other words, I had additional download
capacity throughout the Gentoo download. If the three that were seeding
me were not choked, why did they not send at a faster rate? Because
Comcast was "shaping" my download? Because Ktorrent reports them as not
choked when they really are? Very mysterious things, these torrents.

Yes and no. They have an obligation to protect themselves from customers 
who impact other customers and from customers who violate laws as well. 
They have an obligation to adhere to generally accepted accounting 
principles, etc. In other words, it's not as simple as "The customer is 
always right" any more.

That said, when I first got Comcast and started doing Linux CD/DVD 
downloads using Azureus, it seems to me that I usually got max download 
speeds unless the seed population was too sparse to supply what I 
needed. I forget how long it's been -- three years, maybe. I haven't 
seen such download speeds recently, so either there is more demand for 
bandwidth than there is supply or something else has changed.

That also said, they blocked port 25 on me last weekend without telling 
me. I had to queue up in their chat line to find that out and get a 
workaround from them. All they would tell me was that there was 
excessive email coming from my account. It may have been excessive 
*bytes* -- sometimes I send decent-sized (4 MB) PDFs and that may have 
triggered their alert mechanism.

Well, that actually included two phone lines so the real cost was about 
$50.  Still expensive.  Prices should drop with IPv6 since it will 
provide enough addresses for everyone in the world to be issued one or 
two at birth and keep them for life  ;-)

Technically, only in as much as what is defined in the terms of service 
agreement. Which I don't think too many people have read in full nor 
declined using their service based on it except a few enlightened people 
on this mailing list.

The problem I have with many ISPs is that they set invisible limits, 
don't tell you when and why they're employing traffic control 
mechanisms, and they don't provide any accounting of your bandwidth usage.

I can second the recommendation for SpiritOne, having signed with them
last year after hearing about them on this group.  But they don't
provide DLS services in Corvallis (where I live), so I use them only
as an ISP (hosting eehouse.org).  I used Qwest for DSL until a couple
of months ago, then switched to Comcast when Qwest confirmed that only
their slowest speed service was available to my house and work
requirements made that inadequate.

The Comcast installer (who, FWIW, was cool with my no Windoze in
sight) said my IP address would never change.  He was right for the
about a month.  But I use ez-ipupdate and zoneedit to keep my IP
addresses available.  And for the occasional time that doesn't work
have hourly cron jobs that record IP addresses out where I can get
them.  Works for me....

I think that Denis is hinting at a moral and ethical obligation which goes 
far and away beyond any merely legal entanglements.

After all, the law is there only to atttempt to reconcile design flaws. 
Doing what is legal is doing the bare minimum and I would argue that we 
have an obligation to do much more than that.  The source of that 
obligation is the enormous dependence we have on our society and culture; 
for the technology we were given free of charge by the billions of people 
who came before us -- from the computers we use to the language we speak 
-- and for the culture itself and all of the art and literature that gave 
us this rich, fertile soil upon which we build our lives and in which we 
grow our own ideas.

The legal obligation is what you cite when someone is being egregiously 
antisocial, but it is not our sole obligation to society.

I agree that it is unethical to provide a network that is not transparent 
-- that changes the form or content of the data or the shape of the 
bandwidth that crosses it.

I don't understand what benefit you think you would receive from your ISP 
tracking your bandwidth usage.  Surely this is something better done by 
the users themselves.  It is, after all, personal information that is 
maybe not such a good thing to collect in a big database outside the 
control of the people it concerns.

Actually, they have no obligation whatsoever to protect themselves from 
customers who violate the law -- at least as not insofar as those 
purportedly illegal actions are not service effecting.

First, you must remember that whether or not an action is against the law 
is solely the determination of the judicial system.  It is not for Comcast 
or any other private entity to decide whether or not the actions of anyone 
but themselves are in violation of the law.

Second, network carriers are not responsible for any illegal actions 
carried out by their customers.  As a common carrier, they are shielded 
from such legal responsibility.  Should a customer be suspected by some 
legal authority to be breaking the law, there are channels and regulations 
that define explicitly how the law enforcement agencies can and should (if 
their interest is, indeed, upholding the law) interface with the ISP to 
take appropriate, legal action.  Anything beyond that legal proscription 
is a violation of the rights of the users and of the ISP to go about their 
lives unmolested.

As I wrote in my previous post, their obligation goes far beyond the 
legal.  And going back to Denis' question, their obligation to inform 
customers has nothing at all to do with any of these legal obligations.

What, if anything, frees them from the ethical responsibility of sharing 
their policies and practices on the handling of customer data with their 
customers?

I completely agree that they should be transparent but they aren't. The only
way to get them to change either policy or force them to be more transparent
is to speak with your wallet as it were.

The only *real* way to determine if they are shaping is to set up sniffing
on both ends of any given connection and be able to rule out other network
elements. It could be that they have reversed their course and aren't
shaping but other ISP's may very well be doing so, with or without telling
their customers.

Any business internet account would get full bandwidth accounting 
complete with bar graphs, pie charts, and threshold alerts for 
over-usage. The point of it is to see how much actual bandwidth you're 
consuming. I would imagine the average 40hr/wk working person is on the 
internet from their home approximately 20 hrs/wk. And for that same 
average person a very small percentage of that time is for 
high-bandwidth usage.

If I'm hogging bandwidth and making internet access in my neighborhood 
miserable for everyone else than I should pay more. You have to 
understand how these companies dole out bandwidth. The industry standard 
is to over-subscribe 4 to 1. They are just trying to get as many people 
signed up for access and are banking on the fact that *most* people only 
use their connection a few hrs/day and *generally* don't consume large 
amounts of bandwidth for long periods of time.

There are plenty of other ways to make them change.  Indeed, "voting with 
your dollars" can just as easily induce an appearance of change with no 
real change or, as is much more often the case these days, encourage the 
company to force its competitors either out of business or to adopt the 
same screwed-up business practices.

An effective way to make them change is to go work there and change 
things or tell the world what they are doing and what happened when you 
tried to change things.

These organizations are not autonomous beings.  They are made of us and we 
make them.  They do exactly what we say.

[snip]

Well, you have to be a customer to do this... and presumably not an 
employee (otherwise you'd likely have other means of testing).  So there 
are other ways, but none that don't involve being complicit in the act.

People just need to be blowing way more whistles.

But I guess that's why they call it wage-slavery.

A terms of service agreement (policy) is not *just* for legal purposes. 
It's the agreement that your master (ISP) makes you agree to how you 
(slave) will use the service. You could easily not be breaking any law 
but using a lot of bandwidth via streaming media and seeding ISOs. But 
if your ISP decides that usage is not with their policy they apparently 
have the right to terminate your service at any time and you have no 
rights. Welcome to Corporate America...

Agree with most, though I suspect the "average" person (besides having
one mammary, one testicle, and being mostly dead) is on the 'net far
less than 20 hours per week.  The average person is also not using the
telephones, the roads, or the sewers continuously either, which are all
systems that work only because of the averaging of large numbers of
random and low-usage customers.

In the early nineties, I designed a line of chips called "non-blocking
crossbar switches" for a company called I-Cube Design Systems.  They
were originally intended for hardware logic simulation, but I-Cube's
original simulator customer ended up in legal battles over patents.
I-Cube found themselves a new customer that could use switches, a small
Bay area outfit called Cisco Systems.  The 'net took off, Cisco took
off, and I-Cube had by far the best switch chips at the time.

Most companies provided switches that were small and complicated and
slow.  They tended to use something called "Banyan Trees" based on the
idea that the average amount of traffic needed fewer switches than a
complete "any to any" matrix.  That made the switches "blocking", that
is, an established route could prevent another from taking place.  This
only occured in periods of high usage.  However, usage of any 
oversubscribed resource is usually "fractal", meaning that there are
periods of very high usage that don't conform to bell curve statistics.
For land-line telephones, it is Mothers Day.  For sewers, it is the 
Superbowl station breaks.  And for the internet, it is news events and
(locally) slashdotting.  Banyan tree networks crumble under the load,
way-overbuilt non-blocking switches do not.

The I-Cube switches were any-to-any and non-blocking - you could light
up the entire switch without blocking messages.  They were also easy to
test, cheap, low latency, and wicked fast.  I-Cube was growing 30% a
quarter, with 50% profit on sales, when the V.C.s decided that they
couldn't explain to IPO investors what the company did, and sent I-Cube
off chasing negative-profit easy-to-explain stuff like Ethernet chipsets.  

The next big shakeup in the net will be the next big event that sends
the zillions of "average" users to camp out online, looking at videos
they can't get from the network.  An oversubscribed network may fail,
angering the "occasional" customers and making them easy pickings for
competitors after the Big Event is over.  

I suspect a lot of customers have 'net connections so it will be there
in an emergency, and are not big everyday users.  Whichever network is
best "shaped" for extreme usage periods will pick up a lot of customers
after the next crisis.  As the cost of provisioning bandwidth continues
to plummet, extra bandwidth, and the ability to allocate that bandwidth
to the maximum number of "average" customers, is what forward-thinking
ISPs should be looking for.   A good proxy for that might actually be
open-source downloads and bittorrent - as long as you can cut throttle
those down when the fecal matter hits the air circulator.

I tried to get it to work here.  No such luck.  Looking at how it works, it
seems to be a horrible hack.  It looks like it exploits a loophole that was
"fixed" in a later security patch.

It looks like the only way to win is not to play.

I have been very happy with SpiritOne/Aracnet.  I almost never see a service
disruption.  Their tech support does not have a problem with Linux.  They
don't bitch about me hosting a mail server.  I have been using them for
about 3-5 years now.  (Don't remember when I started.  Quite a while ago.)

Message-ID: <20080114193006.GB10342@gate.kl-ic.com>


For about 1.5 years, we have been holding the Linux Clinic on third
Sundays at Free Geek.  Aaron Burt has been our Fearless Leader and
the Key Master, so we can get in on a day when the facility is closed
otherwise.  Aaron was trusted with the keys because he is a good guy
and otherwise active in the Free Geek community.  

Aaron is moving to Vancouver B.C., leaving us without a Key Master.
Either John Jordon or I could take on the leadership role, but I am
too busy to be otherwise involved in the Free Geek community, and I
know John is incredibly busy, too.  

So, the question - are there any trusted Free Geek regulars who could
take on the task of letting us in on third Sundays (we usually arrive
at around noon, to start setting up) and locking up after teardown at
530pm?  Other than that, we are self-sufficient (if the router is
working) so there is no other work involved.

Volunteers?

I've also been very satisfied with SpiritOne/Aracnet.  I've been a 
customer since 1995.

I was also a happy Aracnet customer (w/static IP) for a long time. I
jumped ship only to get FIOS, which is available only through Verizon.

   I started with them 1 June 1999 and have no reason to switch ISPs. Their
tech support is outstanding -- infrequently needed and highly responsive,
their SysAdmin is superb, and they encourage their linux users. They also
allow WiFi sharing to the user's bandwidth limit (or you can buy more if you
want it), but don't advertise that fact. They also now handle the DSL line
between here and there so I have less reason to deal with Verizon than I did
before.

   When SpiritOne bought Aracnet I called with several concerns. The
President returned my call within a day and answered each question solidly.
There are several high-quality and high-value ISPs around, and
Aracnet/SpiritOne is among the very best.

I'm a relatively new face at FreeGeek, but I am active there and will
definitely be a seasoned regular in no time. I will be attending the Linux
Clinic on Sundays, and would gladly be this person if a better candidate is
not found.  My FreeGeek id # is 58499.

On a more immediate note, will Kurt be able to get approved by Free

Message-ID: <478CD64B.3060506@comcast.net>

At one point yesterday afternoon the wind was picking up enough to cause
some beeping from my battery backup. Since it appeared that it was just
getting started and was getting worse, I shut down my various computers.
As it turned out, that was the worst of the wind, and we never did lose
power out here.

I have a post-it note that reminds me to change the permissions of
/dev/sg0 to 666 so I can use my scanner without running as root. When I
tried to do that I found that there is no /dev/sg0. I realized that when
I shut down the computer yesterday I also shut off the scanner. I didn't
power up the scanner this morning. I remember that the instructions for
the scanner (when I used to use it on Win98) said that the scanner had
to be powered on before booting or the machine would not be able to find
it.

Is that true of all SCSI devices? I.e., does the hardware have to be
powered up for the system to see before /dev/sg0 will be created?

Is there some way to tell the system to expect a SCSI device sometime in
the future without having it powered up before booting?

Some SCSI hardware does great with hotplugging, but it's not 
universally true.

I think SANE ships with a hotplug script that can be used to identify 
recently arrived hardware, but I don't know if it works with SCSI 
devices.

Various Linux distributions include utilities for rescanning a SCSI 
bus. Google for "$DISTRO rescan scsi bus" for your flavor. Under 
RHEL/CentOS, for instance, the directions (which might also work with 
your distribution) were easy to find:

   http://misterd77.blogspot.com/2007_12_01_archive.html

If all else fails, you can "modprobe -r" your SCSI driver (assuming 
your boot device doesn't use it!), power on your scanner, then reload 
the module(s). Your bus will get a clean scan and sg0 should pop up in 
dmesg.

In the SG utils package there is a script to scan the SCSI bus.  This
will allow you to
see and access devices that were powered up after the bus was scanned.
Actually the devices do show up when you look at the procfs but
getting the device
added requires manual intervention.

Becasue most of the SG driver is now standard in the kernel the script
is in various places
on the net.  My Google search resulted in this one.
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/rescan-scsi-bus.sh-1.25

Adapt it as needed.  The command that is needed is scsi add-device as follows:
        echo "scsi add-single-device $devnr" > /proc/scsi/scsi

Quite a few. There is one mentioned on a list for SuSE 10.1 (which is
what I have) at:

Thanks to you both. When I get some free time I'll give these ideas a try.

We still need a speaker for Advanced Topics.

I have been unable to find anyone for this month.

Ideas?

I'm not sure if you consider open source virtualization or voip solutions
advanced topics. Also, I'm by know means an expert on either of these, but I'm sure I 
would learn even more in putting a presentation together or collaborating with someone else...

How about a topic on .Net and open source? I'm seeing an increase of several
open source tools/apps being developed on the .Net platform (i.e., wiki, bug
trackting, etc.).

If you can all airdrop yourself onto the cruise ship somewhere
between Grand Turk and San Juan, I'd be happy to give a talk on
the Seaside Web Application Framework (http://seaside.st).

Short of that, I'll offer that same thing for the mar 17 (st patty's day!)
meeting.  Seaside, then seasick!  Whee!

What if I made a mistake and added lp to a user group?

If you add a supplemental group you don't want, how do you reverse the

Voip has been done a couple of times.  We have not had a virtualization talk
in a while.

Are you willing to do it?

If I had the time I would do another Cryptography or malware talk.  Life is
eating my time up at the moment.

I am planning to kludge up a device that will have a USB web

very small camera that works well with Linux.  I don't need much
resolution or a high frame rate, and low power would be nice.

Any suggestions?

Actually the problem may not be the wireless card at all.  DHCP appears to
be pretty screwed up on the latest Fedora 8.  They just pushed out and
update to that and some other network apps.  Hopefully that fixed the
problem.

The card itself works very well.  It has much better reception than the
Athros card or the Prism2 card.  Kistmet shows a huge number of networks.  I
just can't connect to them very well.

If I have to i will revert back to Fedora 7.  It will be a pain though
because there are things in F8 I really need and don't have the time to
build for F7.

Well, I'm pretty sure I can put together enough interesting material to 
talk about. But, I wouldn't have the time to put together an actual 
slide show type presentation. Also some other people have expressed 
other topics of interest; so if there's not sufficient interest it seems 
kind of pointless to talk about something people aren't really 
interested in hearing about.

Message-ID: <478FF0D4.3050206@seitzassoc.com>


When using firefox, I'd like to be able to force the download of a 
file.  In most instances Shift-Left_Button works, but some files get 
rendered in the browser regardless of whether I used Left_Button or 
Shift-Left_Button.  For example, any of the .txt files at this 
location get rendered in the browser.

   http://mirrors.cat.pdx.edu/centos/5.1/isos/i386/

I'm guessing this is related to the MIME type being text/plain.  Is 
there a way to force firefox to download the file regardless of its 
type?  BTW, I realize I can save the page, but I'd rather not have to 
go through two steps.

thanks,
galen

January 21st 2008
7pm - 9pm

Location:  Jax
           826 SW 2nd Avenue

Speaker:  Russell Senior
Topic:    Troubleshooting Wireless Networks

 "I will give a brief description of linux tools useful in 
 diagnosing wifi problems: iwconfig, dhclient, kismet and the like.

 Driver problems are beyond the scope of this talk.  To me, driver
 problems boil down to (a) picking the right hardware or (b) being
 patient and waiting (possibly forever).  At Personal Telco, we focus
 on building infrastructure.  Using that infrastructure is a client
 problem.  We are happy to share what we know, but given (a) we
 already picked the right hardware so we might not have that much to
 share.

 Bearing that caveat in mind, I can try to address specific problems
 raised by the audience.

 I can also talk about my recent MetroFi survey, if people are
 interested."

I don't understand what benefit you think you would receive from your ISP 
tracking your bandwidth usage.  Surely this is something better done by 
the users themselves.  It is, after all, personal information that is 
maybe not such a good thing to collect in a big database outside the 
control of the people it concerns.

Qouted from today's Slashdot Stories:

Time Warner Cable to Test Tiered Bandwidth Caps  

"The plan is to offer various service tiers with bandwidth fees
for overuse, as well as a bandwidth meter customers can use to help them
stay within their allotment. If it works out, they will consider a
nation-wide rollout. Interestingly, the memo also claims that 5% of
subscribers use over 50% of the total network bandwidth."

Does anyone know where one can buy old Cisco hardware?  I'd like to
get a CCNA certification and I want to play around with some Cisco
routers or switches before I take the exam.  I don't need to do
anything in particular (my home network is over-engineered as it is),
except be able to run IOS.

I already checked FreeGeek, but they didn't have anything.  I'd rather
buy something local than pay for shipping from a seller on ebay.

Have you looked at or are you interested in looking at Cisco simulation 
software?
For a less than a couple hundred dollars you can get full-blown 
simulation software for current model equipment and IOS.

A couple to check out are

There is now a Linux port of a Bittorrent application that allows one to download such things as movie trailers and launch them by clicking a thumbnail with the mouse  and then "Play." Or at least, it's supposed to work that way.

I have noticed that this doesn't launch them, but when I click on the file in the containing folder "Azureus Downloads," it launches Kaffeine and plays the videos, quite well in fact. Does anyone know how to make this association within the Vuze application itself?

Update on the Linux Clinic this Sunday:

I spoke with Richard and Sean (activities coordinators of some kind) at
Freegeek about being the "chaperone" for the Linux Clinics every month
(which *probably just means I open the place, close it, and make sure nobody
steals anything). They said that, if the group managing the keys gives the
ok, they will train me tomorrow on how to open and close. Either way, they
seemed pretty confident that somebody would be there to open on Sunday, even
if that person isn't me. So I look forward to meeting some of you guys this
Sunday (and hopefully somebody can help me with configuring ethernet on my
Gutsy install [HP tx1000]).

Cheers,
Kurt

I'll check out Surplus Gizmos, and see if I can get the
Dynamips/Dynagen emulator working, that looks perfect.

I'm not sure how much FreeGeek does specifically with these types of 
organizations. I found an organization on the internet called TechSoup / 
ComputerMentor that does do this type of work extensively but they're 
out of San Francisco.

One of the reasons Debian is my favorite distro is that there are groups 
of people who have spun-off Debian specific distros for educational, 
medical, and non-profit to name a few. They're all in various states of 
production readiness. I setup a computer lab for a small tech college 
with DebianEdu (Skolelinux). I was very impressed with it and I would 
like to do more of this type of work.

Is there any interest in founding this type of organization in Portland 
if one does not exist already?

Hello PLUG,
I don't post often, but I thought I would share my experience lately with a
few tools I have been using in a mix FreeBSD and Windows environment.

Cacti:
Open source SNMP monitoring tool that collects various data from hosts and
graphs performance and availability trends. Useful for capacity planning,
network switch and router performance, and graphing anything really that has
a string or calculable delta.
http://www.cacti.net

Zabbix:
Open source SNMP and Agent-based monitoring tool that performs similar
functions as Cacti, but uses installable agents to get more information
about a host system, such as running processes, database monitoring, system
health (raid status, power supplies, etc).
http://www.zabbix.com

SNMPTT:
Collects SNMP traps, and translates them into meaningful human readable
content. Useful for translating vendor or enterprise specific SNMP trap
messages and various OIDs. Can send those traps into a database, to an
external program, or as SMS messages and e-mails.
http://www.snmptt.org/

In my environment, we are monitoring a broad mix of FreeBSD, Windows, and
various networking equipment. Using the above tools give us superb
visualization and feedback on the performance and availability of our
systems.
I've always been meaning to write somewhat of a guide to get these setup,
but the individual websites do a much better job of that than I could.

I hope these links help others who have been looking for production quality
open source monitoring programs!

I'm going to be trying this out soon.  Currently I'm using a mix of
nagios and munin for health checks and stats.

Zenoss is another application, but it didn't look as baked as Zabbix
when I reviewed them a few months ago.

Munin is super easy to get working out of the box for those who need
some instant gratification for host stats.

Shameless plug for my company, OpenSourcery.

http://www.opensourcery.com/

We do a lot of work for non-profits, state government, k-12, and
sustainable business.  This includes development with Ruby/Perl/PHP, and
all aspects of IT/Networking, mainly Ubuntu/Debian platforms.

Just this week I migrated from a Nagios/Cacti setup to a Zabbix one.
I've been using nagios for years... but zabbix quickly gained my favor
for ease of configuration, speed, and "triggers".

You do not have to use agents to watch network services like IMAP,
DNS, etc. You can also use SNMP instead of the agent. It has pretty
good jabber support as long as you include it during the ./configure.

I highly suggest it!

I used the VMware edition of Zenoss while trying out various systems, and
was not impressed.
They are trying to merge all of the functionlity of Cacti, Nagios, and
inventory functions into one package -- admirable effort, but it doesn't
feel "as one" still.
And the UI is not intuitive, left me second guessing where I should be
looking for information -- not what I want to do when I want to get
something quickly.
Their commercial version may be better, I did not do a product demo of that
yet (and their prices make me inclined not to look at it either).

Zabbix, Cacti, and SNMPTT fill 100% of our needs, with minimal hardware and
training overhead.

If anyone used BigBrother/BigSister, then I would suggest Zabbix, as you
will be familiar with the concept of "traps", for handling events.
Zabbix also has a built in SNMP trap receiver, but I have not attempted to
use it because the documentation is sparse and doesnt seem to do all that
SNMPTT can do.

I just spent about 4 months doing some real hard testing, evaluating
(testing in production, writing tools to manage, integrating with
other apps) Zabbix/Zenoss/Hyperic/someothers to replace a
Nagios/Ganglia/Cacti system I've built over the last few years.  IMO
in summary, if you want to do anything more complex/custom than the
out-of-the-box features, Zabbix is the best bet (and is period).
Hyperic is closed-source in part and isn't very flexible, Zenoss is
great in theory, but changes require __LOTS__ of coding for the
middleware (Zope), and most of the features really are half-baked, and
most bugs were slow to get resolved (if ever).

Zabbix is the most extendable in a variety of ways; while I dislike
writing PHP, it is utterly simple, extensible, and fairly
flexible/capable (and only runs the frontend), support for SQL
backends is great and good for integration with external tools.
Zabbix flat out kicks ass as far as extensibility (able to arbitrarily
add SNMP/agent/script -based collection), custom collection methods
via any scripts on any platform (even Windows!).  Only problem is in
really large setups (thousands of monitored systems) which most people
probably won't run into... while I've spent over a month
isolating/fixing bugs with the Zabbix developers, its' still insanely
resource-intensive.  They HAVE been unbelievably responsive in fixing
each and every bug or performance/scalability issue I've brought up.

Even better, zabbix isn't a crippleware/restricted/dual-licensed scam
to get you hooked: the software is fully-featured, all GPL2.  The
support is CHEAP, at least several tens of thousands of dollars per
year cheaper than the nearest competitor in my situation.

Caveat emptor:

While I can monitor the same number of hosts (though fewer metrics,
less often) with RRD-based systems on a single quad-proc/8GB machine,
Zabbix is now requiring (with ~2000 hosts, ~100,000 values, avg
5-minute resolution) two dedicated 8-way MySQL servers, a 32G SSD and
4TB of FC-SAN.  It doesn't scale the same as RRD's with their
automatic reduction in resolution over time and simple pre-sized
binary format.  It DOES give you the ability to keep as
high-resolution data as long as you want, and amazingly it allows for
actually doing this, which nothing else has even allowed to this
degree of precision and granularity.

Cheers,

/eli

I am running into an off problem.

I have a command line that works.  If I put it into backticks in a korn
shell script, it breaks.

What I am trying to do is execute something similar to the following:

ncftp -W "site var1=1, var2=2 var3=3" host filename /path/

If I use backticks, it seems to use the quotes as literals.  (So it tried
to send '"site' to the server and process the first option as the
hostname.)

If I use backslashes to escape the spaces, it does the same thing.  It
works on the command line, but in backticks it takes everything literally.

Any ideas what I am doing wrong.

One local company that does a lot of work for government, charity, and
other NGOs is  Open Sourcery in SE Portland.  That is Brian Jamieson
and a half dozen other programmers and sysadmins.

http://www.opensourcery.com 

I've never hired his services, but Brian and I are both members of POSSE,
the Portland Open Source Software Entrepreneurs (http://www.posse.org),
and I've worked on a few volunteer projects together with him.  He is
knowledgable, competent and diligent, and I assume that is true for the
rest of his organization.

Instead of backticks, try enclosing the command in "$()", ie:

   $(ncftp -W "site var1=1, var2=2 var3=3" host filename /path/)

No guarantees. I don't have access to genuine ksh at the moment.

My friend Kevin Karwaski lives in Portland these days.  I have CC'd
him.  He is an avid Open Sourcerer and probably knows of some
companies and/or organizations that donate time to helping migrate to
free software.  If not, he may even want to help out as an individual
:-)

Wow, thanks for all the responses! Mostly, I'm interested in 
working/volunteering for such an organization. After many years of 
working in IT for big corps, using mostly proprietary solutions, and 
chasing the all mighty $, my consciousness of what can be accomplished 
with open/free software has expanded immensely over the past 2 years.

I'm still very much a babe in the open-source world, I cut my teeth on 
Micro$oft, Crisco, Checkpoint, and Nortel but now I have worked with 
LAMP, Debian, FreeBSD, Asterisk, open source monitoring and network 
security tools. Working with open/free software has  greatly increased 
my skill, knowledge, experience and understanding. So, I'm very 
interested in finding a way to give back to the open/free software 
community and helping other people find and implement open/free 
solutions to their IT problems. And if I could do that for some kind of 
organization that's working to make the world a better place to live, 
then it's a dream come true...

As someone who's still very new to open source monitoring tools, I have 
to cast my vote for Munin. Quick and easy to setup, plug-ins are a dead 
simple to write with any scripting language. Also, 1 advantage I feel 
Munin has over other SNMP based systems is that it uses collects data 
info via sysstat, (a collection Linux performance tools such as iostat, 
sar, etc.) I feel this provides greater data accuracy and a deeper level 
of insight into your servers.

I introduced Munin at my last job with a small internet startup and the 
developers just loved it and wrote all kinds of plug-ins to get a better 
understanding of how the system they wrote was functioning.

In addition, the NcFTP package comes with some utilities that might be
better suited for shell scripting, namely "ncftpget" and "ncftpput".
These have a command-line syntax, so you can easily substitute names, etc.

Hi Keith and any other members on this list who know about POSSE,

I read your below email that you sent to the PLUG.  I became
interested in POSSE because of it.  I looked at their web site, and
the last posting at http://www.possepdx.org/tracker occurred 23 week
ago.  Is it an active organization or has the initial enthusiasm worn
away?

Sincerely,
Victor Soich

Well they don't match in DNS.
67.138.24.31 looks up to be ns1.gloeblinks.com but
ns1.gloeblinks.com looks up to be 67.138.24.30

ssh sees that as possibly trying to spoof an address via DNS.  SSH is
justifiably paranoid.  Get DNS fixed so that forward, and reverse
lookups match, and the error should go away.

It means that dns and reverse dns did not return the same info.  They
appeared to be separate hosts...

It means that dns and reverse dns did not return the same info.  They
appeared to be separate hosts...

   Why? So unauthorized folks can enter the network here? Neither that IP
address nor that domain name is allowed access.

Is it the DNS server for a domain, or IP address that is allowed? That
might also cause it to show up.  If they aren't allowed you can try
emailing them, or their upstream provider about the unauthrized login
attempts.

It looks like eli.net is in charge of both IP addresses (Integra
Telecom).  I see hostmaster at eli.net as being the contact for DNS
administration.

I'd guess it means you don't have that IP or domain in your 
/etc/host.allow file (which you said) and with the DNS mismatch it is 
warning that the access was made.  As Daniel said.  I'm guessing you 
have nothing to do with "gloeblinks.com" therefore the concern.

Does line 8 have anything on it?  Are there more than 8 lines in 
/etc/hosts.allow?  Is your /etc/hosts.allow file _organized_ ie. all the 
sshd: lines are together and something different after line 8?

   Only the local network and local IP address. My question was why the
warning message referred to a specific line in /etc/hosts.allow when no
external hosts are allowed ... unless the username and password are known
and approved.

   I've reported these cracking attempts in the past and never heard back
from any ISP. As long as the firewall and security software keep them out
I'm happy.

Thanks,

Rich

Rod,

   Apparently the access passed the firewall but was stopped by sshd.

   That's correct. Nothing to do with the domain or IP address.

   ALL: LOCAL @appl-ecosys.com

   Yes.

   Yes. There are specific local IP addresses for the allowed hosts and then
the ssh directives.

For a couple of years I have had a Java application installed on Gutsy x86_64 that does syntax trees. Here are the links:

Author's website:
http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~donaldd/index.htm
Program home page:
http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~donaldd/treeform.htm
Sourceforge download page:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=159595

What I have installed is version 0.2, which never worked very well. A few days ago the author released version 1.0. I have downloaded and installed it, but when I try to run it I get:

jjj at Devil7:~$ java -Xmx256m -Xms64m -jar /home/jjj/Software/TreeForm/TreeForm.jar

jjj at Devil7:~$ 

The memory options in the above command line are from a readme file in the zipped download. Deleting them doesn't make any difference, but that doesn't surprise me because the above errors all seem to be related to classes. 

I have Java 1.4.2 (Blackdown, or whatever it is now in Synaptic), Sun 1.5 and Sun 1.6. For 1.6 I have downloaded and installed upgrade 4 from Sun's website. According to the program website TreeForm is supposed to be compatible with all of these. 

I e-mailed the author last night and this morning received a response:

------
I have seen one other with difficulty running TreeForm on a 64 bit system.  I do not know
why except to say you need to run it on Java 1.5 because I no longer have the ability to
test on 1.6 until Mac releases that version.
Believe it or not I don't know how to do this in the command line and if you can find out
I'd love to know the answer.  I'll post it on sourceforge and add it to my batch command!
------

Having difference versions of Java installed always struck me as weird, although I have done so for a long time without problems. But one question is, how do I specify on the command line that it run on 1.5?

>From googling I gather that you can add classes, but I don't even know what a class is, let alone if this is accurate or how to do it. I know nothing of Java (or any programming language, for that matter). Would adding classes solve the above problems?

Any other suggestions?

If you have 1.5 installed, I think you'll need to set your paths and 
environment variables so everything is where it is expected to be. On 
Gentoo Linux, there's a "java-config" that does all of this for you:

# java-config -L
The following VMs are available for generation-2:
1)	Sun 32bit JRE 1.6.0.03 [emul-linux-x86-java-1.6]
*)	Sun JDK 1.6.0.04 [sun-jdk-1.6]

If I had more versions, they would show up in the listing and I could do 
"java-config -S" to select it.

I can't help you with other versions of Linux. As a side note, I left 
Debian for Gentoo mostly because Debian had this religious attitude 
against Java and Gentoo supported it. If you're not on Gentoo, you can 
probably get a quick answer on the forum for your distro.

Ah, that jogs my memory. At one time I needed to set the default version of Java in an attempt to get OpenOffice.org database working. (It failed to help.) There was a command that listed the installed versions and then you could select the one you wanted to set as default. It was like your "java-config -L" command, but when I try that now I just get "command not found." Either it's something else on Gutsy, or I need to install it. I looked at man java, but all I found was java - version. That got me:

jjj at Devil7:~$ java -version
java version "1.4.2-02"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build Blackdown-1.4.2-02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build Blackdown-1.4.2-02, mixed mode)

Evidently 1.4.2 is set as the default. 

I also searched Synaptic for java and java-config, but found nothing. 

Any Ubuntians know how to set the default version of Java?

Super simple, the new version is compiled with a newer version of Java than
you have installed.

Try upgrading to the latest version of Java and try again.

That's what I needed!

It listed five different Javas, the default being the last one (Blackdown 1.4.2). I changed it to Sun 1.5. TreeForm now launches and runs great!

Thanks a bunch!

Message-ID: <422ec1510801210511r220e0fa6ve4924a180cee608d@mail.gmail.com>

Anybody else find "MSN SideGuide" creepy?

I hate how it hogs my screen real-estate. Reminds me of why I stopped
watching TV a long time ago... all the ads, and flashing BS. It really
bothers my Metro-Fi experience. I get the feeling it could potentially be
intrusive, but I don't know much about it so it's probably a bit of
paranoia. Still, very annoying.

According to this press release, *"MetroFi will replace its existing banner
ads, sponsor logos and paid search features with MSN SideGuide for users
with Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems."* That is definitely
not the case: I'm running Vista and XP and I get ads on both the browser
window and the "SideGuide". It's good that non-windows users don't have to
deal with SideGuide, but if they do actually phase out the browser-based ads
for windows users, then the non-windows users will be stuck with
browser-based ads. I sat and stared at the ads for a while just to see if
anything was Portland specific, and didn't see anything. I find that kind of
hard to believe since Portland paid for it. I wonder who chooses or filters
out the content displayed in the SideGuide? Probably some jerkoff, but
that's just a guess.

Another thing I read from MSN was "The (Metro-Fi) network will be coupled
with a suite of Internet services designed by Microsoft to help consumers
find locally relevant information." I'm not really seeing that. But I did
see and interesting articles about Beyonce's new album, and how cool George
Bush is.

Not really, it only affects users of that other, inferior operating

I have tried both of these.  Does not help.

Something in Korn is making the exec act wonky on strings with quotes in
them.  It ignores the quotes and just splits on spaces.  If you use the same
command on the shell prompt, it works fine.

I am working on getting them to let me rewrite the whole damn thing in
Perl.  Korn is just too damn inconstant.

Maybe I should see if the same problem exists in Bash.

You should submit that as a success story to MetroFi.  To be annoyed
implies that you were able to connect.

Alan,

You might double check what the "SHELL" env variable is set to.
If it is not set to ksh, that could explain the problem.

Since it's theoretically only for windows machines is is possible to 
fake it out with the user agent header in firefox?  Or is it doing

MythTV can control a device such as a sat/cable box via IR, is that

I have space on my XP laptop to load VMware Server (which I have done),
and want to try different versions of Linux on it starting with Kubuntu.
Has anyone done this?

The laptop is an Acer Aspire 1640Z with a 1.7 GHz Pentium M and 1 GB of
RAM. I accepted the defaults when I created the virtual machine: 512 MB
memory, 8 GB Max hard disk, bridged Ethernet.

What things will I wish I had know after I've started?

Of all the possible downloads, which one(s) should I start with?

TIA.

Ubuntu has pre-made virtual machines here:
http://isv-image.ubuntu.com/vmware/

If you install by yourself, you will want to install the guest
addition drivers.  Also, you might want to check out VirtualBox
instead of VMware...

I've created Linux VMs using the ISO files. But now there are actually
quite a few Linux OS Distro Appliances. If you're not familiar with
the VM Appliances, here's a short article -
http://www.petri.co.il/virtual_top_5_free_vmware_appliances.htm.

One of the nice things about appliances is that you can just use
vmplayer and run whaterver appliance you want. Which makes test
driving Linux distros quick & easy.

Here's the main link for vmware appliances - http://www.vmware.com/appliances/

> Of all the possible downloads, which one(s) should I start with?
>
If you're referring to Linux Distros, that's like asking which flavor
of ice cream should I try at Baskin Robbins. For me, it's the distros
that I consider interesting: CentOS, Gentoo, dyne:bolic. You could
read some of the reviews on distrowatch.com and then find vm
appliances for those distros that tickle your fancy...:-)

I hope that helps.

I've just started playing with virtualization, and it occurs to me
that since client-bridging on wireless is a bit of a hack when/if it
works, it might be a problem to get network access via your host
system's wireless.  I haven't tried it, so I don't know it won't work,
but I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't or if it behaves in
unexpected ways.  Nat'ing through your host system (if that's even
possible) should work fine.

In my case, I am using linux/kvm and running windows (not my choice, i
assure you) on top.  W2k's pinball works surprisingly well, even
tunneled over ssh to my desktop.

If you should end up using a version wit KDE 4.0, keep in mind that
the developers made a deliberate decision to release version 4 before
it was really stable, so your experience may not be representative of
the "normal" kubuntu level of quality.

That said, I have no plans to use [x|k|]ubuntu again -- I've had far,
far to many problems relating to the way the UI seems to be
intertwined with non-ui configurations (power management, wifi, etc..)
 I think debian is a more reliable system, but ubuntu does make more
things work by default if you're happy with Gnome, KDE, or Xfce.

VMWare will only bind to one adapter. It generally selects your primary
one (hardwired port). I "cheated" by adding a second virtual network
tied to my eth1 (wireless port). But I have to switch the VMs to use
that or the primary.

I run both Kubuntu and Ubuntu, as well as Knoppix and DSL, in VMware
Workstation under Linux and VMware server under Windows XP (work
machine). There are no issues....it just finds everything. I usually
build my hard drives out (allocate all storage now). Some are built as
servers, some as workstations. I haven't had any real problems with 7.04
or 7.10 ('buntu) or anything after Knoppix v3.1 and DSL 3.4+. I don't
normally run sound or plug in anything into USB. Networking and KVM just
work. Make sure you install the VMware tools into the client system though.

Not true!  VMware will bind as many as you tell it to :-)  In general,
eth0 is mapped to vmnet0 and eth1 should be mapped to vmnet2.  vmnet1
is automatically mapped to host-only networking.  You can reconfigure
this behavior with vmware-config.pl during installation or at any
time.  I usually map both my wired and wireless interfaces on the same
virtual machine and don't have issues.  One time I mapped 24
interfaces for a project I was doing at Cisco :-)

Kristian - thank you for clarifying. I meant to say that by DEFAULT it
only binds to a single physical Ethernet adapter. Your explanation was
much clearer than mine. And I did exactly the same, binding eth1 (my
wireless) to vmnet2 while eth0 (my wired 100BaseT) was bound to vmnet0
(default bridged network).

Sorry it wasn't as clear as your description.

Not entirely true.  There is a utility that is installed but not
placed on the menus
which allows binding to different network cards and even adding more binding
to the config.  This is outside of the vmx files.

With vmplayer installed the path to the utility is:
C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Player\vmnetcfg.exe

Don't!

1) You don't need to, this particular problem only presents itself to
Windows users, not Linux users.  Many people including myself have
confirmed this.

2) User Agent munging considered harmful.  If they want to know what
you're using, why not tell them what you're using or nothing at all?

I'm curious not for myself, since I've never actually been able to 
connect to a MetroFi node, but for people I know who are stuck on windows.

It seems that it's the user agent parsing that's harmful.. every time 
the user agent is munged it's to get around some stupid web site/service.

I am stumped with this one...
I would like to have a group of users that can kill processes on a linux 
server without using sudo. I would like them to be able to just run 
'kill <processes ID>' and have it work for any processes.

This does not sound secure... I know, trust me but its better than 
putting everyone in the root group.

Any idea how I would accomplish this?

Can you make kill setuid root, or make a kill synonym that is setuid
root and which calls kill with this privilege?  Just a stab in the
dark.

To limit this to a particular group you'd need a custom version of the
'kill' utility. It would check the group membership before allowing
the operation, and it would have to be setuid root. A small amount
of C programming would be required. Some sloppy C programming could
lead to some interesting exploit opportunities.

But.. this what sudo is for (it's NOT for 'sudo bash'... i.e. providing 
a root shell with your user password). I would allow all people in said 
group access to run the kill command via sudo.

As other people said - just create setuid a C wrapper that takes the PID 
argument and kills it. Only allow people in the desired group to execute it.

I would love to use sudo, it is just not an option. We have some vendor 
provided sofware that uses a ncurses gui. From the gui as far as I can 
tell it tries to kill processes when users try to cancel "jobs". I 
cannot change the command used to kill the processes.... hence this 
email. It would be wonderful if I could just change it to use sudo 
/bin/kill rather then /bin/kill.

If you're going to go to trouble to implement a wrapper then you might
also have it restrict which PIDs can be killed. Now allowing PID 1 to be
killed by any not-root user would a good start.

What if you tweak the PATH of the environment this ncurses gui is
running in so that it finds your custom kill script before /bin/kill?
You could then write your own kill that invokes gtksudo or some other
version of sudo that will pop up a dialog for a password.. (or there
are ways to make sudo not require a password)

This is a good time to remind PLUG members that we have a library
of mostly new books at http://www.pdxlinux.org/wiki/PlugLibrary . 

You probably won't find the particular textbook your instructor
assigned.  It is usually a good idea to buy the textbook, perhaps
used, there are websites for that.  If you are generous, you can 
donate it to the library when you are done.  The assigned text may
not have all the information you need, but it will have most of it.

However, the PLUG library contains many books covering some of the
same subjects, at least a chapter or two, and sometimes a different
author or treatment will help you understand a particular topic that
the textbook author cannot explain well.  Most of the time, there is
some book or journal article that explains the topic better than the
textbook author(s) do.  After all, 90% of what a textbook writer
writes about is not their speciality.  It is often better to read
what the authors read in order to write the textbook.  It is better
still to read newer work;  the textbook writer drew from materials
older than the textbook.  The new stuff is in the PLUG library.

Please read the instructions on the wiki, and let me know a day or
two in advance, and I will bring them to a meeting.  At the very
low rates books are being checked out, you probably can keep the
book a long time before someone else wants it.  I would like to
get these books out of my basement and in use!

Why not write two scripts: one that takes your user's input and copies it to 
a file /tmp/process_to_be_killed, and a second (with root privileges)  that 
runs as a cronjob every minute or so, looks at the contents, if any, of 
/tmp/process_to_be_killed, and kills those processes? You can get a little 
more sophisticated and have said cronjob look first at a list of jobs that 
are not permitted be killed (maintained by you), prior to taking action.

Because that sounds like a temporary file race condition waiting to happen :-)

Hey Keith,

I briefly mentioned this earlier, but have you ever considered housing the
PLUG library in the FreeGeek library? I was in the FreeGeek library the
other day browsing through the books, and though it was a cool place, no
people around to bother you, plenty of comfortable couches, lots of nice
books. It's always good to combine forces.

Although it might be less convenient for PLUG members than having
Keith hand deliver them, I concur with kurt that if they aren't
getting used sitting in Keith's basement, I think we should get them
to where they will be used and Free Geek (assuming they have space and
it sounds like they do) would seem like a likely spot for that.

Oh - one more thing.  About half of us live out in the 'burbs;  
a trip to Free Geek to read a book on site is a lot of long trips.

They may end up there if nobody borrows them and I want them moved.
However, last time I checked, there is no good way to check out a
book from the Freegeek library, and reading a computer book can take
weeks.  Some libraries are "read in the building only", for example,
the Toronto public library or the Library of Congress, but they are
usually open close to 24x7 .

First, does it call the kill binary or use the kill system call?  If
it does the kill system call, you will have a harder time wrapping it.
 Probably have to use LD_PRELOAD libc wrapper.  Which kill binary does
it call?  One possibility is to replace the binary it calls with a
shell script that does "sudo /bin/kill.real".  If it just does "kill",
then setting the PATH like somebody suggested so it uses your wrapper
script will work.

BTW, you can configure sudo so that users in a group can only run
"kill".  You can even configure it so that they don't need to enter
their password.

Do you know why this only applies to the orders placed on the first
day? (How did you find out?)

Thanks for the heads-up.

I'm not that surprised.)

I would assume due to logistics of training the order takers, but I
cannot confirm that.  All I know is that an OLPC representative told
me this over the phone when I tried to track down my order.  I have
edited my original LJ posting to include that documentation...

Thanks for pointing this out, Kristian!  Your article pointed out some
information I wasn't aware of (check your spam folders for
OLPC-related email!  Or just read Kristian's article and included

Subject: [PLUG] xorg mouse pointer shows in wrong place
Message-ID: <000001c85f7e$3bbc18c0$b3344a40$@com>

I have a small system running OpenSUSE 10.3 with Xorg-X11-server 7.2-143.9.
My graphics card is an ATI Radeon X1050 -- not the greatest card but good
enough for my purposes.  My monitor is a Westinghouse wide screen 47" LCD.
After installing the card, the screen was coming up in 1280x1024 resolution.
Things were looking a little stretched horizontally, but otherwise it was
working well.  The mouse worked fine.

I edited /etc/X11/xorg.conf to change the resolution to 1920x1080.  Now the
image looks great - it fills the screen top to bottom and side to side with
no horizontal stretching.  The only problem is with the mouse.  The mouse
pointer on the screen doesn't correspond to the where Xorg thinks it is.
Horizontally it's fine, but vertically I have to position the mouse pointer
farther down from the top than the item I want to click on by about a factor
of 2.  So, if there's an icon 3 inches down from the top of the screen that
I want to click on, I have to place the mouse pointer 6 inches down the
screen to hit it.  For things on the bottom half of the screen, the mouse
pointer actually has to move completely below the bottom edge of the screen
(which it will do, logically at least).  Horizontal positioning is fine.

I've been searching and tweaking without much success.  Can someone give me
some help on how to get the visible mouse pointer and the effective mouse
pointer sync'd?

The xorg.conf and log files are here:  http://www.martinconsulting.com/xorg

Are you going through any type of KVM device?  Or are your
mouse/keyboard/monitor plugged directly into the computer?  I have
seen this issues with KVM devices above certain resolutions...

Got a link to online docs for that driver?  All I get from google is 
wikis.

  (**) Input device list set to "/dev/gpmdata,/dev/input/mice"
  ...
  (==) fglrx(0): Silken mouse enabled
  (==) fglrx(0): Using hardware cursor
  ...
  (**) Mouse[1]: Device: "/dev/input/mice"

I would investigate whether gpm is causing trouble (though it looks like 
gpmdata is unused.)

And/or whether there's anything in the ATI driver for hardware/software 
cursor settings.

The fact that the cursor only *displays* in the wrong place implies that 
it is likely a problem in the display driver.

There are a lot of options set in your video driver section.  Without 
some docs, it is tough to say whether one of those is causing trouble.

I've also never seen the InputFashion option.  New in 7.2?

Have you tried disabling hardware cursor?

No KVM is involved.  Just direct-connected PS/2-style IMPS mouse.

I haven't found much either.  Here's a copy of the spec sheet:
http://static.tigerdirect.com/pdf/Visiontek_900120_DataSheet.pdf
And here's a different set:
http://ati.amd.com/products/RadeonX1050/specs.html

I've seen references suggesting that the X1050 is a renumbered/remarketed
something else.  The vendor configuration utility identifies it as an ATI
9600 series board, though it doesn't identify it more closely than that.
Their utility, however inserted the video driver items in xorg.conf, and
they wrote "ATI RADEON 9600 Series (RV350/RV360 4152)".  That still hasn't
gotten me to any docs, though.

> I would investigate whether gpm is causing trouble (though it looks like

gpm isn't running.

> And/or whether there's anything in the ATI driver for hardware/software
> cursor settings.

The vendor's interface is very simple.  Just a few choices about resolution,
color, etc.  Nothing there regarding cursors at all.

True.  Those are what the ati-config utility created, but they may be
inappropriate for this resolution.  The box said that 1920x1080 was
supported, but with the footnote that it would require "user configuration".
I take that to mean "The hardware supports it but our configuration tool
doesn't."  I suppose I could start fiddling with them at random, but I don't
have much confidence in that.

> Have you tried disabling hardware cursor?

No.  Sounds like a reasonable avenue.  How do I do that?

I'm running out of memory on my laptop, which is partitioned with openSUSE
10.3 and Windows. What I'd like to do is wipe the drive and do a clean
install of openSUSE 10.3 so I can use the whole hard drive. I don't even use
Windows on this machine, and I want to experiment with formatting the entire
hard drive. Anybody know of a good utility I could use to do this? Any

Well you could just use the disk partitioning tools during the SuSE
installer, and just repartition and wipe the drive.
If you don't care about the old data possibly being retrieved later (i.e.
it's just you using the machine), this should be sufficient.

If you want to be more thorough, you could use a DoD type tool.
My favorite, useful when customers want their drive wiped, is Boot & Nuke,
which is on the UltimateBootCD (ultimatebootcd.com).
It is a mini Linux distro itself, and is text based menu driven, it is
capable of DoD level hard drive wipes, with random or NULL data, multiple
passes, etc.  Basically just select the level of wipe, and fire 'n forget.

For something easy and close-at-hand, most Linux's, including SUSE come with
"shred".  It may not reach the DoD level, but may be adequate for your
needs.  It's on Knoppix and the SUSE live-CD too.

I'm going to try out  Boot and Nuke, that sounds like what I want to do:
boot, nuke, then install. Thanks.

 resolved my mouse pointer problem, but without really knowing what caused
it.

The original sequence of events was:

1) The SUSE installation created an xorg.conf file, with a resolution on my
monitor of 1280x1024.
2) I followed the procedures to install the ATI driver, in which their tool
updated xorg.conf, but still left it with a resolution of 1280x1024.
3) I changed the resolution to 1920x1080, and my mouse pointer graphic
didn't match where the OS thought it was.

I resolved the problem by going back to the original xorg.conf, and swapping
steps 2 and 3.  So I changed the resolution before running their tool to
configure xorg.conf for their driver.

The result was a radically different xorg.conf that works fine.  The working
copy is available at www.martinconsulting.com/xorg/xorg.conf.works for
anyone that's interested.

Thanks for your help, everyone.

   This is probably something I should know, but I don't. I'm curious why a
40.9M tarball is seen by postfix (and pine) as 56M large when attached to an
email message. The size discrepancy is more than the difference between 1000
and 1024.

I believe it's because of mime encoding, translating the 8 
bit-per-character tar file into a 7-bit-per-character attachment 
increases the total number of bytes needed to represent the file.

Subject: [PLUG] Sharing an offsite virtual machine as a VPN hub
Message-ID: <20080128171928.GA30867@gate.kl-ic.com>


I have a rented offsite virtual machine (Xen) for various tasks.  I
use it to set up VPN tunnels to my various sites, and to my laptop
when I am out.  This allows me to build stable connections to my home
network on a dynamic IP address and behind a firewall, for example.
The virtual has a second IP address, with port 80 on that address
connected to a VPN port.  That means I can run a VPN from my laptop
through an offsite firewall that is configured to block all but web
traffic (Providence Medical Center in NE Portland is like that).

OpenVPN can be configured to do this for many, many networks.  A
mimimum virtual machine costs $20/month from many places, and extra
IP addresses are typically $1/month .  With routing set up properly,
the virtual networks can be kept separate for each person.  The only
practical limit to how many ways you can split one of these "VPN 
hubs" is security - eventually, the crowd will get large enough to
include someone untrustworthy.

I can imagine 5 people splitting one of these virtual machines, and
paying $5/month for the ability to VPN into their machines through
a remote machine, with a dedicated port 80 inbound address for each
person.  Without the port 80 kluge, it would be cheaper. 

I would like people to have something like this for the Linux Clinic,
or for Linux Workshops, so that we can reach out and touch people's
machines for software installs, debugging, and the like.  In those
cases, the connection from home/office to the hub can be activated
only temporarily, for the duration of the clinic.  The connection 
is initiated from the home/office, not from the hub, so the time
exposure of the home/office networks can be limited.

I'm not going to run something like this, but I wouldn't mind helping
set it up for someone else to run, if we can use it for the clinic. 
I can imagine it becoming a paying business for someone doing remote
maintenance of Linux boxen under contract, so there are other reasons
to consider getting involved.  Anybody want to spearhead this?

Brent,

   Ah, that makes sense.

This level of disk wipe does not really delete the data, you need a 
minimum of 5 passes, 3 passes random data, one pass all 1's, one pass 
all zeros.

You are incorrect sir.  The 'Guttmann' paper only applies to older
drives.  The myth about recovering data after /dev/zero is false and
is a very old DoD standard that applies to only certain types of drive
encoding.  Read the paper.  Read the rebuttals.  The rest is hype...

While true that you need multiple passes, the data that is sent in gets run
through a scrambler then a NRZ function to reduce the frequency range.
At one time you could use a scope and read the data patterns from the device.
Not any more.  If you really wanted to make sure; you would reverse engineer the
polynomial that is being used for both the CRC and the scrambler to find the
patterns that give the highest and lowest frequencies written to the disk.

Also be aware that the new SATA drives also support the same function
as SCSI/Fibre
channel drives do, what used to be called CE space.

Why the infinite loop?  Wouldn't this work:

dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx

A single pass won't prevent forensic recovery of data.  You need at
least 5 passes.

   Additional security. No one can access the disk while it's being written.
It'll probably be a TSA requirement soon.

OK, but infinite passes?  If your inifinitely paranoid, melt it down to slag.

On a slightly different flavor, why all the DoD stuff?  Sure, it's
great for discussion, but I didn't get the need for a DoD-level wipe
from the original post:

If it was me, I would boot SuSE's install and use its partitioning
tool to remove the old partitions then continue with the install.
Technically, that's only repartitioning the drive and not wiping it.
But if that's all that's needed, why go through the extra fuss?

You're right, all the DoD stuff wasn't necessary, but that's what I did to
the drive anyways, just for fun. My objective was just to get rid of the
Windows partition to free up space for openSUSE. I used Boot and Nuke. It
made 3 passes. It took about 6 hours, but this morning it said "disk wiped
successfully", so next is the install.

I would have tried to repartition the drive but I'm not exactly sure how to
do that.

Kurt,

   When you initiate the installation of a linux distribution, all (most?)
first ask you how you want the available drive space partitioned. You can
also use fdisk/cfdisk to see what's there, and change it if desired.

   Of course, any time you repartition (unless you use a tool like
PartitionMagic), data are wiped out.

Data is not wiped even if you use gparted on most Linux installers.
You can even resize NTFS without losing data.  The partition may be
altered/resized/deleted, but the data is still there of course :-)

Exactly.  The repartitioning step just rewrites the partition table.
It is the next step, in most installers, that formats the selected
partitions.
Granted if you alter the partition table, it can make it more difficult to
get to the data, but it is still there if you know how to get to it.

Depending on the tool used, you can usually tell the installer to format
/dev/sd[x] and not format /dev/sd[y], for example in my case I have a
separate /home partition that I don't format when upgrading/reinstalling.  I
just did this recently when installing Fedora 8 fresh over F7.  Going from
F6 -> F7 I did an upgrade, and it got a little messy, mainly because of
using livna 3rd party repository.

In the OP's case you would just set all the partitions to format, and it
would've "wiped" the old data, though not to DoD standards.
It sounds like the OP wanted to accomplish 2 things here- wipe out Windowz,
and learn about data wiping tools.  So mission accomplished, it sounds
like?  Tell us how the SuSE install goes.

Install went great. One thing I like about wiping and then installing was:
learning a bit about the tools to wipe the drive, not having to get involved
too much in the partition scheme, since the openSUSE install disk defaults
to (what seems to me) a good partition scheme. I realize that my knowledge
of how to partition and modify an existing partition is pretty week and I'm
looking forward to changing that.

Feels good to run 'df -h' and see 16G's available on /dev/sda2 and 33G's
available on /dev/sda3, AND no entry for Windows. Thanks guys.

Base64 encoding typically increases the size of attached binary files

If it /must/ be wiped clean, I'd use something like Darik's Boot n' Nuke 
CD <http://dban.sourceforge.net/>. If it just needs to be repartitioned, 
however, I'd use something like fdisk.

Comcast had an outage in my area this afternoon. When service was restored, I could not connect to the Internet through my router; I had to run an Ethernet cable from my laptop to the cable modem. Comcast was of no help; they don't support routers.

I telnet-ed in to the router's manager menu (Netgear RT-314) and ran the status routine from the system maintenance menu. It showed the WAN port status as 10M/Half, and showed a few packets being sent and received between the cable modem and the router (this while the Ethernet cable was still connected to the router). However, it showed no IP address for the WAN port. BTW, when the cable is no longer connecting the router to the cable modem, the status of the WAN port reads Down.

Now, with the cable connected to the laptop, I find that the laptop does have an IP address, and that I can send this e-mail.

Any recommendations on where to dig next to figure out what happened, and how to correct it will be greatly appreciated.

 Disk wiping usually means making the prior content unrecoverable. If
you mean you want to repartition and reformat a HD then you can use
partition magic or even an install CD/DVD for linux or GNU Parted.

http://www.tech-faq.com/free-partition-software.shtml

By memory do you mean HD space? If you need more memory for the computer
then check to see if your computer can accept more physical memory.

This might be stupid  to ask but  if you plug in the cable modem to the
router then powercycle the cable modem, then the router and see if service
is restored. The cable modems cache the mac addrs

Stupid laptop keyboard!

I was going to say that cable modem cache's the mac of the last attached
device, so you have to powercycle the cable modem wipe the cache.

Not a stupid question at all. I did think of that, and tried it to no
avail. However, at your prompting I tried it again, and this time it
worked. I pulled the power connections from both the cable modem and the
router and waited several seconds. Then, I reconnected the power to the
cable modem, waited a few seconds, and reconnected the power to the
router. I watched the lights do their blinking things, and tried to get
e-mail. I'm replying the way I normally do, through the router.

Thanks for prompting me to try again something that didn't work the
first time. Maybe I didn't wait long enough to power up the router the
first time.

Subject: [PLUG] Command line and paths
Message-ID: <20080130000042.c08839d1.johnxj@comcast.net>

This has me shaking my head. Hopefully someone can explain what is going on.

I have a Java application that I run on Ubuntu Gutsy x86_64 using Sun Java 1.5. Actually I have several Javas installed, but that is the one that is set as the default, and the application won't run without it being the default. Luckily no other application cares, so all is well.

The problem is that the application has a number of buttons which are displayed with the use of icon files. The icon files are all in the correct folder, but the icons have never displayed. All I get is a little white box where the button is supposed to be. There are also popups explaining what the boxes are, so it is not critical that I have the buttons, but it would be nice to have them.

This evening I got an e-mail from the developer saying that he had figured out that to get the icons to appear you have to launch it from the command line while being in the folder where the .jar file is located. Thus, I need to:

cd ~/Software/TreeForm102
java -jar TreeForm.jar

This works great. The application launches and the buttons appear. 

But it's a lot easier to launch it from the Gnome panel application launcher. I had a launcher for it previously (which did not display the buttons), so I edited it so that the command line is "/home/jjj/Software/TreeForm102/java -jar TreeForm.jar." But after doing so it still launches without the buttons.

So then I went back to the command line and changed to my home folder. Then I entered the same command, but including the path in the command. It launches without the buttons. To clarify:

This command launches it with the buttons:
jjj at Devil7:~/Software/TreeForm102$ java -jar TreeForm.jar

If I change to ~/ and launch it with this command it launches without the buttons:
jjj at Devil7:~java -jar /home/jjj/Software/TreeForm102/TreeForm.jar

Why should it make a difference if I am in the folder or if I specify the folder by stating the full path?

I don't know how this was developed, but perhaps the icons are in a
relative path to the execution environment.  You could easily just
make a shell script that cd's to the directory and runs it from there
and add this as a launcher to your Gnome Desktop or whatever.  Other
than that, I would have to see the environment to know why it was
failing.  Hth...

This app is using relative paths to find the image files -- that is,
instead of looking for
"/home/jjj/Software/TreeForm102/buttons/button.jpg" it's looking for
"buttons/button.jpg" (for example).

The directory that you start the application from is the location that
these relative paths are resolved from, so if you launch treeform from
your home directory, it will look for images in
/home/jjj/buttons/button.jpg (following along with my fictional
example)

> cd ~/Software/TreeForm102
> java -jar TreeForm.jar

By changing directories you've changed the location that is used to
resolve relative paths, so now treeform is looking in the correct
place.

Generally, you can set the directory that an application runs from
when you create an application launcher, but when I just fired up
gnome-panel and tried it I didn't see anything related to this.  (I'll
try not to rant about gnome.)

As Kristian pointed out, you can also create a simple shell script
(say, Treeform.sh):

#!/bin/bash
cd ~/Software/TreeForm102
java -jar TreeForm.jar

make that executable:

chmod a+x Treeform.sh

and point your launcher at that.

This doesn't change the directory you're *in* when you launch it -- it
just tells Java where to find the jar in excruciating detail.

Dick,
Glad its working again. May have been a timing thing or it could just be
buggy firmware on the router. I had troubles with Netgear routers losing
their DHCP lease from the cable modem and no matter how much I powercycled
it, it wouldn't renew the lease. That said, I've had trouble with Linksys as
well so its not a vendor specific problem.

   To keep the shell doing what you want, consider creating a subdirectory in
your home directory called, for example, shell-scripts. In this directory
write a three-line script for your java apps and others you want to invoke
from an icon or menu. Make the script executable (e.g., 'chmod 755
treeform.sh'), then call the script from your icon.

   The treeform.sh script would look like this:

cd Software/TreeForm102
java -jar TreeForm.jar
cd

   When run, the PWD will change to the Software/TreeForm102 directory, then
invoke the java application from within that directory. When you exit, the
PWD returns to your home directory.

I've had cable Internet service since TCI introduced it in the Oregon
City area -- 1995? -- and have had the router almost as long. One of the
things this experience has uncovered is that the router only supports
10M/half duplex on the WAN side. It may be that the cable modem I
started with only ran at 10M/half duplex, but I know that the new one
that was installed a couple of weeks ago supports 100M/Full duplex.

Today's question: Would I really notice the difference if I got a new
router that supports 100M/Full duplex on the WAN side as well as the LAN
side?

And, which routers do you folks prefer? I'll consider adding wireless
capability, too.

Do you use port 80 TCP or UDP?

My company developed this about three years ago. At the time, our
application was protecting children on the Internet by separating
them from the raw Internet. It failed to sell because nobody was
interested but the software is still there.

For me, the ability to run my own linux-based firmware on the thing is
paramount, so I would pick something with that in mind.  Of those, I'd
go for one of these:

  Linksys WRT54GL 
  ASUS WL-500g Premium

The Linksys is the currently available version that still is
practically reflashable (as opposed to most of the off-the-shelf
versions you are going to find, er, on a shelf today).  The ASUS is
not a device I've ever had my hands on, but they are well-regarded and
also have features common to one I have used extensively: a mini-PCI
slot which allows you to change the radio; and 2 USB2 host ports,
which lets you plug stuff in.  Bear in mind these are consumer-grade
devices that might fail suddenly for no obvious reason, but usually
don't.

For others, see:

  http://wiki.openwrt.org/TableOfHardware

Another more expensive device that I like are the Soekris boards.  PTP
uses them for outdoor wireless gear (in a suitable NEMA enclosure).

  http://www.soekris.com/

There are other similar products as well.

I created the shell script and it works great that way. I copied and
pasted the explanation and script patch to the developer. Hopefully he
can fix the Java code so it finds the right folder.

I'm a bit fuzzy on how scripts work if they don't have a sh-bang
(#!/path/to/interpreter), but isn't the trailing "cd" is unnecessary.
It looks like the script is still running in a new invocation of the
shell, and doesn't impact the invoking environment.  (what shell does
the script use if there is no #!/.... ? and why does this even work?)

Rogan,

   Good point. Most of my shell scripts have the sh-bang on the first line,
but some don't (soffice.sh, for example). All explicitly return to ~/
without harm or foul.

You need to find out where Mozilla, Firefox, Netscape, or Opera is
installed to.  It isn't /usr/lib/mozilla.  If you use firefox, run
this:

ls -l `which firefox`   #(note that those are *backticks* not single quotes)

and see where the symlink points--you'll only need the directory. (on
my ubuntu box, it's /usr/lib/firefox)

If you use this form of the command you won't have to
add the caution about using backticks:

ls -l $(which firefox)

So .....

As it turns out...

I am using the default web browser for Debian.   Epiphany..

So the path is:

/usr/lib/epiphany/2.14/plugins/

And it doesn't like that either.....

Thanks for all the help so far..

I can't see why they should.  If it is 'source'd, then any `cd`s within 
the script would impact the calling shell (which may not be in ~ -- and 
thus it should be remembering the initial $PWD and trying to return to 
that -- though that may not exist by that point (lots of fun exercises 
for the reader there), but to keep it simple: 'source'd scripts should 
really just not cd at all.)

If it is not sourced, then the subprocess is just trying to `cd` 
immediately before termination.  This hides the exit code of (what 
would otherwise be) the last command from the caller and instead 
returns the exit code of `cd ~`.

So, if the script just does environment setup and then runs a command, 
this practice masks that command's exit code and is likely to bite 
someone doing e.g. "for i in *; do some_wrapper.sh $i || break; done".

AFAIK, whether it has a shebang has nothing to do with any of that.

   Because I explicitly put 'cd ' as the last line in each script. Should
have mentioned that more explicitly.

If you run the script, it doesn't matter.  It only matters when you
source the script, and you really shouldn't be sourcing scripts.

As I said:  it does matter if you expect to get a meaningful return code 
from the script.

If it "doesn't matter" (aka: "does no good") to end the script with `cd 
~` and it gets in the way of returning the exit status, then why do it?

If I always use the side door, does it matter that my front walk has 
broken glass on it?

I had a similar problem a couple of years ago, Linksys router, Comcast 
cable modem. The router would not get a DHCP address, I did the whole 
power cycle dance, waiting the recommended 30 seconds, nothing. Gave up 
and called Comcast, they said to connect a PC directly to the cable 
modem, which did get an address. Comcast said to update the firmware in 
the Linksys, which ultimately fixed the problem. I hate it when Comcast 
is right. ;-)

I strongly recommend the Linksys WRT54G (apparently L is the FLOSS 
version). Secure, cheap, fast, and easy to manage. Linksys provides 
timely firmware updates, and as Russell says, they actively support Linux.

Older WRT54G's (like several years ago) were reflashable, the current
ones are not anymore[1].  Start with v5 they used something other than
linux and also cut the amount of ram and flash.  However, to satisfy
the reflashers they also started selling the WRT54GL which is
approximately the same as a WRT54G v4, which is reflashable.

[1] "not" in a "practical" sense.  you can still reflash them, but the
    space available is so limited, the utility of the resulting device
    is very low.  In other words, "it doesn't work".

Not only do I need some advice on a good wireless router, but also a good
place to buy one from in my area. I live in the SE 39th and Hawthorn area,
hoping there's something closer than Fry's. Moved here form CA recently so I
don't know where anything is yet.

As for a wireless router, I have a Netgear WGT624 v2, and a Netgear WGT624
v4, and they both crap out every time I start downloading large files.

One weird thing about wireless in my area: if metro-fi goes down, everything
else seems to go down. I've tested this several times with 4 separate
laptops, on several different occasions. This is probably a separate topic,
but here is a scenario: I check the AP's on 2 - 4 different laptops,
Metro-fi and Metro-fi premium are up. Metro-fi goes down, and new AP's
become visible (confirmed on multiple laptops). Right now, for example,
Metro-fi and Metro-fi premium are up (which are apparently the same AP). If
I connect to Metro-fi, eventually it will go down, then 2 - 4 new access
points will go up, in addition to Metro-fi, yet, Metro-fi will not deliver
internet. Moral of the story is, maybe there is some frequency issue going
on in my area, but I'm not sure how to test for that (really want to learn
though, so point me to a reference or tool-set if you know of one). If there
is a frequency issue, I may not need a new router. I would like to try a
Linksys though, as I've never had any trouble with them.

Yeah, even with a comcast account, I'm still complaining about Metro-fi ;)

I agree with Russell and others who recommend the old(er)  Linksys gear.  I
have a  54G  that I've had for 4 years or so. I'm running the paid firmware
from here http://www.sveasoft.com/ and its been great.

Kurt - Try Fred Meyer should be able to pick up something reasonable there.
As to your question about the AP's bouncing up and down. I could be totally
wrong but I'm going to posit that its probably channels banging against each
other, I don't know enough about Metro Fi or the wireless situation around
your area so someone may have more info then me. I know when I started
getting neighbors moving into my apartment complex who added wireless I had
to change channels a few times because my AP kept dropping because we were
using the same frequency.

Regarding purchasing a wireless router, if want a WRT54GL or the Asus 
router, you will probably have to mail order it.  For other computer 
stuff, try Pacific Solutions(pacificsolutions.com) at 5118 SE Powell 
Blvd.  They are very Linux friendly.  There is also Belmont 
Computers(belmontcomputers) at 4505 SE Belmont St.  After that, it's 
Freddy's or the big box stores farther east.  BTW, none of the 
Freddy's carry much in the way of computer gear, it's mostly 
accessories(input devices, cables, blank media, etc.).  However, you 
should know that the Hawthorne store is particularly small.  Other 
Freddy's are typically larger.

   That's always a good option, and Newegg (www.newegg.com) is a good vendor.

   FWIW, I have a couple of Linksys WRT54GC wired/wireless routers. The 'C'
means compact, and it is tiny. You can add an additional antenna if needed,
but it works well here in the house without it. The second one I keep in my
traveling office bag so a single wired 'Net access point can be shared
wirelessly by others without taking any wired hosts off the 'Net.

in addition to Freddy's ,Office Depot down on MLK not far from Burnside

I wonder if the Multnomah County Library would be willing to take the 
books and then make them available in their collection.  The books could 
be linked to directly in the MCL online catalog from the PLUG site.

It appears they already have a number of Linux related and other 
technical titles.

Message-ID: <599832.46424.qm@web502.biz.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

So what are the people saying that predict the stock market changes? They are saying that in 2009 Microsoft's stock will sink as a result of 2008. However lets not forget the Mighty Microsoft ZUNE, XBOX 360 with it's Red Rings, and their new Surface that should be coming out at $10,000.00 a piece.
Thanks to Edwin Recently I have had the opportunity to Sell 1000 Ultumix Desktop PCs to an Indian reservation for use in playing Bingo with Video and Voice over Lan via Skype, or ekiga. After this Sunday we will know for sure if we have the bid or not. The main issue now is remastering Ultumix 0.0.1.2. Please keep us in your prayers. Remastering Linux Mint is not that easy. It simply does not want to be rebuilt. 

After selling 1000 computers the following year the Indian tribe will have us build 100,000 clients for them all over the US. This should generate at least a million dollars that can be put towards jobs in the US and giving back to Linux.

 Linux has kept a big chunk of the server business out of Microsoft?s hands. But in 2008, Linux will hurt Microsoft on the desktop. Here?s how.
 A new computing platform
 Thanks to Moore?s Law and evolving application needs, a new computing platform arrives every 10 years. Mainframes in the ?50s, minicomputers in the ?60s, PCs in the ?70s, microcontrollers in the ?80s, PDAs and cell phones in the ?90s and now sub-$400 - soon to be sub-$300 notebooks. 
 Small and light enough to be carried everywhere, these sub-notes provide Internet access, PDA functionality and basic mail and document creation functionality at a rock-bottom price. Asustek is expected to build 1,000,000 Eee sub-notes in Q1 ?08 alone. Asustek?s competitors are just getting warmed up.
 What can Microsoft do?
 Microsoft has gotten fat on the $50 Windows tax it charges PC manufacturers. But on a razor-thin margin vendors can?t afford Windows.
 So they?re going with Linux. If Asustek sells 5 million Eee?s, and their competitors sell another 5 million, several million consumers will be introduced to desktop Linux for the first time.
 And millions of copies of Windows and Office won?t be sold.
 Microsoft will skate in ?08
 For all the attention Apple gets for its growing market share, the Linux-based sub-$400 notebook/sub-$200 desktop unit sales will be several times as large in 2008. Even combined this won?t hurt Microsoft in 2008, thanks to the growing migration to Vista.
 2009 is a different story. 25 million Linux desktops will take a bite out of Microsoft sales - one that Wall Street will certainly notice. 
 The Storage Bits take
 Microsoft?s days as a de facto monopoly are coming to an end - and not a moment too soon. Increasingly desperate attacks on Linux will intensify, but how does Microsoft go after Wal-Mart?
 Comments welcome, of course. How should Microsoft respond to very-low-cost Linux systems?

You folks were recommended by a Dr. friend at the VA, so here goes...

I have been using Red Hat 8.0 for a little while, as a programming
platform, and recently decided to take it online.  I purchased a USB
modem by Agere (generic?), and seem to be having a problem getting 
Kppp to recognize it.  The driver, according to the machine, is set 
to generic, and everything else seems to be right.  The device is 
dev/ttyS0, which corresponds to all my references.  Could this be a 
driver issue? or is something else going on that I don't catch?  ANY
ideas would be greatly appreciated.

I was planning to install FreeFem++, one of the few free applications that is comfortable with the numerical solution of partial differential equations. I configured, but soon after I typed "make," it told me that it would like to have gcc-2.95 installed because the results would be better. It doesn't seem to be readily available (with SuSE 10.3), but in any case I am also concerned about possible conflicts with later versions of gcc that are installed. Any suggestions? Otherwise I might just tell "make" that I'd like to proceed regardless, and projects will take a little longer to process.

John,

Java applications have a couple of file-system references at their
disposal:  the current working directory (cwd) and the "classpath".
Files can be found relative to those two things or relative to the root
(which latter is to be avoided, for portability reasons).  What it can't
do so easily is find out the path to the command that invokes it.  In
this case, as others have mentioned, it's probably finding the images
relative to the cwd.  So if you aren't invoking it from where the JAR is
(the "cd" solution), the develop can't "fix" it without some work.

However, you might pass this along to him:  if he packs those image
files into a JAR (either the main executable JAR or another in the same
directory), then he'll be able to load them via the classpath, and you
won't have this problem any more.  Obviously it's better if all his
users don't have to write shell scripts to run his program, as you've
had to do.

I can explain how to accomplish that, if the developer is interested.

--Jason

I created the shell script and it works great that way. I copied and

can fix the Java code so it finds the right folder.

Since the old version is not directly installable then you will need to

Here is a link for installing and running multiple version of gcc.

That sounds a lot like an interference problem.  There are only three
non-overlapping channels: 1, 6, and 11.  That means the some (though
not much) of the power transmitted on channel 1 will be audible on
channel 5.  Naturally, the closer you are to the transmit channel, the
more this cross-channel interference you'll hear.  That fact pushes
most, but not all people on to 1, 6 and 11.  Some people operate on 3
or 9 or some other channel because it lets them hear their own AP
better amongst the noise, while generating noise for two of their
neighboring "non-overlapping" channels.

As for checking for interference, my first knee-jerk suggestion is
kismet.  It will show you which APs are present on which channels, and
also which ones are audibly active from your location.  

Kismet[1] (properly configured) will show you 802.11 traffic.  There
are other users of 2.4GHz spectrum though.  Like, lots.  There are
cordless phones, microwaves, bluetooth, etc, etc.  One tool that
purports to provide information on all of that is something called a
wi-spy[2].  It is a small USB dongle and software that will generate a
plot of rf energy by frequency across the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band.
Personal Telco has talked about buying one of these at various times,
but hasn't.  Partly because one of our members has one already and
we've been able to borrow it in a pinch.  But, having to borrow it,
means that it isn't readily at hand, and we've got to have sufficient
"activation energy"[3] to follow through on it.  They used to be
reasonably cheap (around $100), but recently about doubled in price.
You can get one with a detachable antenna for about $400 now.

A limited output from dmesg after you plug it in will be very useful.
It is unlikely that the USB modem is at /dev/ttyS0. That port is typically
your first onboard serial port (what DOS and windows would call Com1).

People have been saying 'this is the year of linux' almost every year since 
red hat first went public. I don't believe there will ever be an official 
'year of linux' but that either one of two things happen. 1: more and more 
people will slowly begin using open source software (linux) until it reaches 
the point that 'everyone' realizes how stupid the concept of proprietary 
software is when compared to open source. 2: proprietary software companies 
get laws passed which mandate trusted computing modules to be fully 
implemented on all computers, these same companies become the final judge on 
what is 'trusted' (rather then letting users judge for themselves) and open 
source software dies because there is no longer any hardware being made that 
it will run on anymore.

So what are the people saying that predict the stock market changes? They 
are
saying that in 2009 Microsoft's stock will sink as a result of 2008. However
lets not forget the Mighty Microsoft ZUNE, XBOX 360 with it's Red Rings, and
their new Surface that should be coming out at $10,000.00 a piece.
Thanks to Edwin Recently I have had the opportunity to Sell 1000 Ultumix
Desktop PCs to an Indian reservation for use in playing Bingo with Video and
Voice over Lan via Skype, or ekiga. After this Sunday we will know for sure 
if
we have the bid or not. The main issue now is remastering Ultumix 0.0.1.2.
Please keep us in your prayers. Remastering Linux Mint is not that easy. It
simply does not want to be rebuilt. 

After selling 1000 computers the following year the Indian tribe will have 
us
build 100,000 clients for them all over the US. This should generate at 
least a
million dollars that can be put towards jobs in the US and giving back to
Linux.

hurts Microsoft
Linux has kept a big chunk of the server business out of Microsoft?s hands.
But in 2008, Linux will hurt Microsoft on the desktop. Here?s how.
A new computing platform
Thanks to Moore?s Law and evolving application needs, a new computing 
platform
arrives every 10 years. Mainframes in the ?50s, minicomputers in the ?60s, 
PCs
in the ?70s, microcontrollers in the ?80s, PDAs and cell phones in the ?90s 
and
now sub-$400 - soon to be sub-$300 notebooks.
Small and light enough to be carried everywhere, these sub-notes provide
Internet access, PDA functionality and basic mail and document creation
functionality at a rock-bottom price. Asustek is expected to build 1,000,000
Eee sub-notes in Q1 ?08 alone. Asustek?s competitors are just getting warmed
up.
What can Microsoft do?
Microsoft has gotten fat on the $50 Windows tax it charges PC manufacturers.
But on a razor-thin margin vendors can?t afford Windows.
So they?re going with Linux. If Asustek sells 5 million Eee?s, and their
competitors sell another 5 million, several million consumers will be
introduced to desktop Linux for the first time.
And millions of copies of Windows and Office won?t be sold.
Microsoft will skate in ?08
For all the attention Apple gets for its growing market share, the 
Linux-based
sub-$400 notebook/sub-$200 desktop unit sales will be several times as large 
in
2008. Even combined this won?t hurt Microsoft in 2008, thanks to the growing
migration to Vista.
2009 is a different story. 25 million Linux desktops will take a bite out of
Microsoft sales - one that Wall Street will certainly notice.
The Storage Bits take
Microsoft?s days as a de facto monopoly are coming to an end - and not a
moment too soon. Increasingly desperate attacks on Linux will intensify, but
how does Microsoft go after Wal-Mart?
Comments welcome, of course. How should Microsoft respond to very-low-cost
Linux systems?

We had similar problems in our cul-de-sac with a NetGear music player
getting bumped off all too easily (seems to be an issue with that piece of
gear).  We tried different channels, but reception for internet radio was
getting dropped all too frequently.

What worked better was putting one of those paper/aluminum foil reflectors
on the  Music player box, pointing to the router.
http://www.freeantennas.com/projects/template2/index.html

Ultimately we went with a powerline ethernet adaptor as streaming was too
erratic for our ripped music.  But the antenna eliminated ~80% of the radio
station drops or disconnects.

We also moved the router further away from the front of the house and cable
modem.

The netgear box sensed 3-5 networks almost any day.

I believe all Agere modems are not modems, but sound boards with the
wrong audio connections (commonly referred to as a WinModem).  The
only generic modems are external modems using the RS232 interface.

If sufficiently ground and roasted, it might make some bad coffee...

They can't keep doing that forever, especially considering that that
Windows susnsets with Vista.

Right now, Comcast is offering 12Mbps bursts on their basic 8Mbps
downstream connections (if you don't know what you have, then you have
this).  You'll probably notice some difference going to full duplex.
While 100Mbps is severe overkill for the application, 10Mbps won't let
you get all you can get out of the burst rate.

802.11(b) should offer enough throughput that there shouldn't be a
bottleneck at the cable mode, and has a slightly larger usable signal
radius on the same transmitter and antenna.  (g) offers more speed,
though if you're having signal problems on g, try b instead; it might
make a difference.

I strongly advise against selecting a router that is not compatable
with dd-wrt, just in case you decide the stock firmware is garbage (it
probably is).  Of those, I advise against consumer-grade units; go
with the commercial grade hardware.  You have more flexability in what
you can do with a signal on the commercial units (like throw on
different kinds of antennas to meet signal requirements, etc), and
it's not as likely to randomly peter out for no obvious reason like
the El Cheapo stuff you find at Best Buy or Fry's.

I'm not that familiar with Java.  But judging from what you write,
classpath is for Java libraries (jar files) as the PATH is for
commands or PERLLIB is for perl.  Is that fair to say?

i'm pretty happy with powerline ethernet between the buildings on our 
property (which are all server from a single meter and breaker box), and 
am glad to hear of others using it. My question - have you ever heard of 
(or tested for) your neighbors beeing able to see your LAN if they're 
using poswerline adapters too?

you can load any resource that you can stuff into a JAR file from the 
classpath - manifest.mf files are common, but i've used classpath 
loading for images, xml, ddl, all sorts of plain text. If i remember 
correctly (it's been ~18 months since i coded Java) most file io classes 
let you load directly from the classpath.

My impression of a quick skim was that the "rebuttal" was filled with
(paraphrasing) "I couldn't find a reference" and "I can't think how
that could work".  That's a kind of negative evidence, it raises
doubts but it doesn't prove that recovery is impossible.

Real mechanisms tend to have real artifacts.  I am reminded of a story
about how the US for a time was able to identify individual russian
submarines radioing home from mid-ocean by means of the characteristic
waveform of the telegraph (or whatever you call that in radio) key
transient.  The listeners had a position from the triangulation of
directional receiver stations, and they had a submarine identity from
the key transient, and could therefore track the russian submarine
movements over time on that basis.

That doesn't mean that disk sector contents can be recovered after
being overwritten.  But it also doesn't mean that just because you
can't think of how it could work, that it can't.  You might just not
be thinking hard enough or might be assuming something that's wrong.
The Russians couldn't think of how the US could figure out which
submarine was talking either, but that didn't stop it from happening.

At least, according to the story.

I look at the router logs occasionally and haven't seen anything that
couldn't be accounted for from our computers.  We have one machine (wndz)
that is often slow downloading email and occasional general web and a gamer
(wndz) that I don't always know what he's doing so I keep an eye out for the
spyware, etc.

So Microsoft will make no further developments to Windows? There will
never be a next version after Vista? How does this keep their income
stream going? Gates owns a lot of stock, but not all of it. Other
stockholders will expect continued income and profitability. Surely
there will be something more after Vista?

Most packages that claim they "need" gcc <= 3.x aren't very well 
maintained. It's more likely they've used language constructs that crash 
the stricter new compilers than it is that there's a performance/code 
generation problem that requires an older compiler.

So ... try it with the latest compiler and beat up on the maintainer(s) 
to get with the program! :) P.S.: Gentoo has a nice way of handling 
multiple versions of gcc:

$ l /usr/portage/sys-devel/gcc

it may work on 32-bit machines.

I agree with your point.  It is an argument similar in form to "one cannot
prove the absence of bugs, only their presence", or the one
from the Principal Investigator at the lab where my wife works, "Lack
of evidence is not evidence of lack".

I do not think the point of the article is that it is not possible to
recover overwritten data,  but that Guttman's original article
provides no basis for a claim that it can be and is being done, and
further,  that those who use it that way are propagating myth.

Subject: [PLUG] Copy/Paste and Java
Message-ID: <20080131195848.cdc28d32.johnxj@comcast.net>

I am continuing to troubleshoot problems with TreeForm, a syntax tree generator program written in Java. Thanks to the developer and help here I have it down to just a couple remaining issues on my Gutsy x86_64 computer. Of these, the most annoying is that copy and paste from TreeForm to other applications fails completely. I have tried all kinds of applications, from word processors to graphics apps, and evidently TreeForm's copy command is not placing anything on the Linux clipboard(s).

The developer told me the solution was on this page.

http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/linux/

To save people time running off to the above link, I have copied and pasted below what it says about copy and paste with Java:

---------------
Desktop Differences (Copy and Paste)

If you have been using Windows or a keyboard with a copy and paste key, you might be wondering how to copy and paste text between Java programs and other desktop programs and terminals.

Linux uses a mouse-driven copy and paste mechanism where mouse button one selects and copies text, and mouse button two pastes the text. This technique works for Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) components because they use the primary selection to achieve copy and paste. Project Swing components, however, use the system clipboard for copy and paste, and most tools on the desktop, apart from the Netscape browser, do not use the clipboard.

A workaround to this limitation is to map a key or mouse button to access the system clipboard as follows:

*VT100.Translations: #override \
            <Btn3Up>:                select-end(CLIPBOARD) \n\
            <Btn2Up>:                insert-selection(CLIPBOARD) \n

The above lines can be passed as a value to an X tool using the -xrm option. Alternatively, the mapping can be made accessible to the entire desktop by including them in the .Xdefaults file in the user's home directory. The command xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xdefaults will reload updates in the .Xdefaults file. 
--------------

The problem is that the above is not comprehensible to me.

First, is the above correct?

Second, if it is correct, what do I do? I don't understand things like "the above lines can be passed as a value to an X tool using the -xrm option." I need instructions for a non-programmer who only dimly understands that Java is a programming language.

I did figure I'd start by adding the lines to the .Xdefaults file in my home folder, but said file does not exist. I opened Text Editor and pasted in the above lines, then saved it as ~/.Xdefaults, and then I did the above xrdb ... command. Still nothing - copying in TreeForm places nothing on the clipboard.

Any suggestions welcome.

Back when I heard it in 06, they were moving to focus more on

Dude, Windows 7 is the same 50 million lines of code that Microsoft
has been crufting-up since NT was born (single millions).  With
Windows 7, it will be even bigger, but attempt to look prettier.  It's
the same insecure OS trying to undig itself out of the back-asswards
architecture they built themselves into.  I first played with Windows
"Longhorn" in 2002.  Yay!  That was nothing like Vista is today.
Where is WinFS and the numerous other features that were supposed to
be integrated?  It all changes so fast at M$ and they are always on
the lookout for a new way to sell computers and more licenses.  With
the shift away from the desktop and into a more service-oriented
architecture, the OS becomes rather meaningless and so why not just
use something that is free :-)  So, this video you speak of is just
Vista with like 2 million more lines of code...

That's its primary function, yes, for loading Java modules required by the
application.  As Joe points out, though, Java can load any sort of file from
the classpath.  (There are stream abtractions that apply to all files,
whether they're loaded via the classpath or using a file descriptor, a URI,
etc.)  And in fact, the classpath may contain directories as well as JAR
files, and Java will search both (in the order in which they appear in the
classpath) for class modules and other files.

The classpath can be passed in the Java command line, it can be defined as
the "CLASSPATH" environment variable, and for executable JARs, it can be
defined in a "manifest" file.  Moreover, the "JAVA_HOME" environment
variable is sometimes used to find the active Java installation.  Juggling
these two variables along with the system "PATH" has caused way too many
headaches, especially for linux users, who are actually concerned about
versions.

If you're wrestling with multiple Java installations in linux, consider this
advice:  don't both with system-wide CLASSPATH and JAVA_HOME environment
variables, and eschew java-configuration tools that create them.  They'll
only get in your way.  Just add to your PATH the ./bin directory in your
latest Java installation, and leave it at that.  Define the classpath (and
JAVA_HOME, where it's necessary) only in local script wrappers.

I've used gentoo's java-config tool, for example, and it's caused me a
ridiculous lot of problems.  Managing Java installations just isn't that
complicated.

I'm not that familiar with Java.  But judging from what you write, classpath
is for Java libraries (jar files) as the PATH is for commands or PERLLIB is
for perl.  Is that fair to say?
